---

A district forming the northern part of the Roman province of Asia. Paul, Silas, and Timothy were forbidden by the Spirit to preach in Asia (Acts 16:7â8); they turned toward Bithynia, which district also was forbidden to them; they then passed through Mysia, without preaching, and came to the coast at Troas.
