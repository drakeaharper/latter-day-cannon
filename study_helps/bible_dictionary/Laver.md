---

A vessel containing water for the priests to wash their hands and feet before offering sacrifice. In the tabernacle it stood between the altar and the door (Ex. 30:17â21). In Solomonâs temple, besides the molten sea, there were 10 lavers on wheels, with bases (1Â Kgs. 7:27â39), used for washing the animals that were to be sacrificed (2Â Chr. 4:6).
