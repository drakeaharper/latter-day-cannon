Hot. Son of Noah (Gen. 5:32; 6:10; 7:13); cursed (9:18â22). The names of his descendants are given in 10:6â7; they were the southern nations: from Cush came the dark-skinned race of eastern Africa and southern Arabia; from Mizraim the Egyptians; from Phut the Libyans; from Canaan the inhabitants of Palestine before the arrival of the Semitic races. See also Abr. 1:21â27, where we learn among other things that Hamâs wife and daughter were named Egyptus, and that a portion of Hamâs descendants settled in Egypt (Ps. 78:51; 105:23; 106:22).
