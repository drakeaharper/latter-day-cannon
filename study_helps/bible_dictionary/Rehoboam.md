---

Son of Solomon by the Ammonite princess Naamah (1Â Kgs. 14:21, 31), and his successor in the kingdom (1Â Kgs. 11:43). During his reign the division took place between north and south (1Â Kgs. 12), being mainly the result of an old rivalry between Judah and Ephraim, which Rehoboam tried to pacify by going to Shechem to be crowned. Much discontent had also been caused by the rigor of Solomonâs government, and by Rehoboamâs refusal to relieve the burdens placed upon the people (1Â Kgs. 12:1â11). An invasion by Shishak, king of Egypt, also weakened Rehoboamâs power (1Â Kgs. 14:21â31). See also 1Â Kgs. 15:6; 1Â Chr. 3:10; 2Â Chr. 9:31; 10â12; 13:7; Matt. 1:7.
