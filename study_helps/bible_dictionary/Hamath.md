---

An important city of Syria, in the valley of the Orontes; the âentering in of Hamathâ was the northern limit of the Promised Land (Num. 34:8; Josh. 13:5). Toi, king of Hamath, was on friendly terms with David (2Â Sam. 8:10). The city seems to have come under the dominion of Solomon (1Â Kgs. 4:21â24; 2Â Chr. 8:4). It was afterwards taken by the Assyrians (2Â Kgs. 14:28). It is still a town of considerable importance.
