Peace. The home of Melchizedek (Gen. 14:18; Heb. 7:1â2; Alma 13:17â18). Salem was called Jebus at the time the Israelites came into Canaan. However, the Tell el-Amarna tablets of about 1400Â B.C. give the name of the city as Uru-Salem (an older name than Jebus), which is easily identified as Jerusalem, the âCity of Peace,â the city of Melchizedek about 2000Â B.C.
