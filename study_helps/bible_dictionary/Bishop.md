Greek episkopos, meaning âoverseer,â an office or position of responsibility. Hence, Jesus is called the âBishop of your soulsâ (1Â Pet. 2:21â25). Judas is also spoken of as having a âbishoprick,â reflecting the fact that the Twelve are overseers (Acts 1:20; D&C 114).

Bishop is also an ordained office in the Aaronic Priesthood (D&C 20:67), and a bishop is a common judge in Israel (D&C 107:74). The desirable qualifications of a bishop are listed in 1Â Tim. 3:1â7; Titus 1:7â9. See also Ministry.
