Stone of help. A stone set up by Samuel as a token of gratitude for deliverance from the Philistines (1Â Sam. 7:10â12). The place had previously been the scene of two defeats (1Â Sam. 4:1; 5:1); and in the account of these defeats it is called by the name it received later on. Its position may have been at the head of the valley of Ajalon.
