Thapsacus, on the western bank of the Euphrates, the river being at that point fordable; a boundary of Solomonâs dominions (1Â Kgs. 4:24); also famous in classic history as the place where Cyrus with his 10,000 troops crossed the river. The place of this name mentioned in 2Â Kgs. 15:16 is probably within the kingdom of Israel; its site is unknown.
