Found in the land of Havilah (Gen. 2:11); used in the tabernacle (Ex. 24â40), in the temple (1Â Kgs. 6â9), and in Solomonâs house (1Â Kgs. 10:16â21). Many instances are given in the Old Testament of its use for purposes of ornament, Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir being the countries from which it was brought (1Â Kgs. 9:28; 10:2). It is figuratively mentioned in 2Â Tim. 2:20; Rev. 3:18; 14:14; 21:15, 18. It formed part of the offering made by the âwise menâ to the infant Savior (Matt. 2:11).
