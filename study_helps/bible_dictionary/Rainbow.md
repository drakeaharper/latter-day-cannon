An outward token of Godâs covenant with Noah (Gen. 9:13; see also Ezek. 1:28; Rev. 4:3; 10:1). The rainbow no doubt existed before the Flood, but with Noah the rainbow took on a new significance as the token of the covenant. JSTÂ Gen. 9:17â25 enlarges the terms of the covenant to include not only that the earth will never again be covered with a flood of water, but also that the Zion of Enoch will return and the Lord will come again to dwell on the earth (see Gen. 9:11 note c, 15 note b; JSTÂ Gen. 9:21â25 [Appendix]).
