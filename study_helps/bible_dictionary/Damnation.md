---

As used in the KJV this word has a wider meaning than is at once apparent from modern usage. Damnation is the opposite of salvation and exists in varying degrees. All who do not obtain the fulness of celestial exaltation will to some degree be limited in their progress and privileges and hence be damned to that extent. See Matt. 23:14, 33; Mark 3:29; 16:16; John 5:29; Rom. 13:2; 1Â Cor. 11:29; 2Â Ne. 9:24; 3Â Ne. 18:28â29; D&C 58:26â29; 84:74; 112:29; 132:4, 6, 27.
