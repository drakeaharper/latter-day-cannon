Asked. (1) Son of Kish and first king of Israel; his appointment (1Â Sam. 9:1â10:27); leads against Nahash (1Â Sam. 11); offers sacrifice (13:9); his oath (14:24â45); war against Amalekites (15:1â9); rejected from being king (15:23); dealings with David (16:14â19:10; 23:24â26:25); slays priests of Nob (22:6â19); his death (1Â Sam. 28â31; 2Â Sam. 1); his burial (2Â Sam. 21:12â14). Saulâs downfall shows the consequences of uncontrolled self-will and disobedience to counsel.
