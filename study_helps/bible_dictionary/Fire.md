Frequently the symbol of Godâs presence, revealed either in mercy or in judgment (1) of His glory (Ex. 13:21â22; Ezek. 1:4, 13; 10:6â7; Dan. 7:9; 10:6); (2) of His holiness (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29); (3) of His presence to protect (2Â Kgs. 6:17; Zech. 2:5); (4) of His judgments (Isa. 66:15â16; Zech. 13:9; Mal. 3:2; 1Â Cor. 3:13); (5) the punishment of the wicked (Matt. 18:9; 25:41; Mark 9:43â48; Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14â15; 21:8); (6) of the Holy Spirit as a purifying agent (Matt. 3:11; Luke 3:16); as tongues of fire (Acts 2:3). On the altar there was a perpetual fire, replenished with wood every morning (Lev. 6:12; 9:24; 2Â Chr. 7:1, 3), which consumed the burnt sacrifice and the incense offering.
