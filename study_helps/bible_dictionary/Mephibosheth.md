---

(1) Son of Saul and Rizpah (2Â Sam. 21:8).

(2) A lame son of Jonathan (2Â Sam. 4:4); with Machir at Lodebar (9:6); Davidâs kindness to him (9:5â13); Zibaâs slander (16:1â4); his defense (19:24â28); David spares him (21:7). His true name was Merib-baal; but later Israelites were unwilling to pronounce the name Baal (Ex. 23:13) and substituted for it bosheth (âshameful thingâ).
