Save now. The word is taken from Ps. 118:25, one of the Psalms of the Hallel. The chanting of this psalm was connected at the Feast of Tabernacles with the waving of palm branches; hence the use of the word by the multitudes at our Lordâs triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:9, 15; Mark 11:9â10; John 12:13).
