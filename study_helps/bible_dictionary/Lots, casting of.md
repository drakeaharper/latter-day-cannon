---

There are many instances in scripture of the use of lots for the purpose of making a choice (Lev. 16:8; Num. 26:55; 33:54; 34:13; Josh. 13:6; 14:1â2; Judg. 20:9; 1Â Sam. 10:20â21; 14:40â42; 1Â Chr. 24:5, 31; 25:8; 26:13â14; Acts 1:26). Prov. 16:33 expresses a feeling on the subject of the Lordâs hand in the matter.
