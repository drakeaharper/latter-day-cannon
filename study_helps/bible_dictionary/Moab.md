Son of Lotâs eldest daughter (Gen. 19:37). The land of Moab lay east of the Dead Sea. The Moabites were akin to the Israelites and spoke a language that closely resembled Hebrew, but there was constant warfare between the two nations (Num. 22â25; Judg. 3:12â30; 11:17; 2Â Sam. 8:2; 2Â Kgs. 3:6â27; 13:20; 24:2; 1Â Chr. 18:2; 2Â Chr. 20:1â25).
