Hebrew Aram-naharaim (see Ps. 60 heading), Aram of the two rivers (Euphrates and Tigris), the name being specially applied to the fruitful country between the upper parts of these two rivers. In this region Nahor settled after leaving Ur of the Chaldees (Gen. 24:10); and here other members of the family remained after Abraham had moved on into Canaan. See Aram.
