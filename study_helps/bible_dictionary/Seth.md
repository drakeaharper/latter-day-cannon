---

Son of Adam and Eve, born in the 130th year of Adamâs life in mortality (Luke 3:38; Moses 6:1â3; 6:9â11). A prophet and patriarch, he was ordained by Adam at the age of 69Â years. He is called âa perfect man, and his likeness was the express likeness of his father, insomuch that he seemed to be like unto his father in all thingsâ (D&C 107:42â43). The record says he lived 912Â years (Gen. 5:8; Moses 6:16).
