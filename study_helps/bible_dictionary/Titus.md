---

Apparently converted by Paul, perhaps at Antioch (Titus 1:4). Attended the conference at Jerusalem about circumcision (Gal. 2:1); probably with Paul on his third missionary journey; sent by him to Corinth as the bearer of 1Â Cor. (2Â Cor. 7:6â7, 13, 15). He then returned to Paul in Macedonia and was again sent to Corinth with 2Â Cor. and with instructions about a collection for the poor of Jerusalem (2Â Cor. 8:4â7). After this we have no mention of him for eight years. At the conclusion of Paulâs first imprisonment at Rome, Titus joined him at Ephesus, and they went together to Crete, where Titus remained and where he received a letter from Paul with instructions about his work and asking him to come to Nicopolis (Titus 1:5; 3:12). Later on he was sent on a mission to Dalmatia (2Â Tim. 4:10).
