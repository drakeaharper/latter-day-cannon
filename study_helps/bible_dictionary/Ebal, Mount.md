---

A mountain some 3000Â feet high, to the north of Shechem, Mount Gerizim lying to the south. Here Joshua explained to the Israelites the curse that would fall on them if they disobeyed the commandments of God as delivered by Moses in Deut. 11:26â29; 27:11â26. See also Josh. 8:32â35. It was also to be the site of a great altar (Deut. 27:2â8; Josh. 8:30â31). See also Gerizim and Ebal.
