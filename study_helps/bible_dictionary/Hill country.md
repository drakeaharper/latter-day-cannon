---

A geographical term of frequent occurrence (Josh. 13:6; 21:11; Luke 1:39, 65), denoting the ridge of hills extending from Jezreel to Beersheba, attaining a maximum elevation of about 3000Ã‚ feet near Hebron. The hills are sometimes bare but more often covered with herbage and shrubbery; the lower slopes are adapted for the culture of the vine, and the valleys are often very fertile.
