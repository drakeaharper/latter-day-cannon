---

A long range of limestone hills in the extreme north of Palestine, rising to a height of eight or nine thousand feet. It is still a land of forests, though the groves of cedar trees have almost disappeared. Running parallel is the Anti-Libanus range, less lofty than Lebanon but including Hermon (9400Ã‚ feet).
