---

A town in the Roman province of Asia, in the valley of the Lycus, near Colossae and Hierapolis. In Col. 4:16 there is a reference to a letter written by Paul to the Church in Laodicea. Other references to Laodicea are found in Col. 2:1; 4:13, 15; Rev. 1:11; 3:14. This last passage shows that the special danger of the church there was its lukewarmness.
