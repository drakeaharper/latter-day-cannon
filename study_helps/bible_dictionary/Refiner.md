---

A man who separates the precious metals from the dross with which in nature they are usually found mixed. Part of the process consists in the application of great heat, in order to bring the mass into a fluid state, hence the term ârefinerâs fire.â Christ is the great Refiner. See Isa. 1:25; 48:10; Zech. 13:9; Mal. 3:2â3.
