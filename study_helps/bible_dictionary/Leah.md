Weary. Eldest daughter of Laban. She became Jacobâs wife through a trick of Labanâs, who passed her off as his daughter Rachel; being veiled, the mistake was not discovered till after the marriage had taken place (Gen. 29). She became the mother of six sons and one daughter (Gen. 29:30â32; 30:17â21; see also 31:4, 14, 33; 33:1â2, 7; 35:23, 26; 49:31).
