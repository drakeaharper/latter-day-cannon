---

Everywhere common in Palestine, both wild and cultivated. Figs were an important food. The tree is one of the earliest to show its fruitbuds, which appear before the leaves; thus a fig tree with leaves would be expected to also have fruit. Jesusâ cursing the fig tree for its fruitlessness (Mark 11:12â13, 20â23) was an allusion to the fruitlessness of Israel. The time when the leaves appear indicates that summer is ânigh at handâ (Matt. 24:32â33; D&C 45:37â38; JSâM 1:38â39). For other references to figs, see Gen. 3:7; 1Â Kgs. 4:25; 2Â Kgs. 20:7; John 1:47â50. The sycomore, spoken of in Isa. 9:10, Amos 7:14, and Luke 19:4, was a variety of fig tree.
