---

A Jew, native of Pontus, settled in Rome as a tentmaker, married to Priscilla or Prisca, expelled from Rome by decree of Claudius, settled in Corinth where Paul met them, and then moved to Ephesus (Acts 18:2â3, 18). At Ephesus Aquila and Priscilla instructed Apollos in the faith (Acts 18:26), and their house seems to have been a center of Church activity (1Â Cor. 16:19). From the references to them in Rom. 16:3 it appears that they returned to Rome, but later on we find them again at Ephesus (2Â Tim. 4:19).
