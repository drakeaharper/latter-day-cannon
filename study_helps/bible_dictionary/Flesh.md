Permission to eat flesh is found in Gen. 9:3 and D&C 49:18â19 (see also 1Â Tim. 4:1â3). JSTÂ Gen. 9:11 (Appendix) adds a caution against wasting flesh or needlessly killing animals. There is a prohibition against eating flesh of animals dying a natural death (Lev. 17:15; Deut. 14:21), partly because they would not have been properly bled. The flesh is often spoken of as being a part of our mortal or fallen nature (as in Matt. 26:41; Rom. 7:5, 14â23; 8:3; 1Â Cor. 3:1â2; Eph. 2:3); as opposed to the Spirit (Rom. 8:5â9; Gal. 3:3; 5:17â25), and as needing to be overcome (Matt. 4:4; Rom. 8:7, 12â13; Gal. 5:17, 24; 6:8; Col. 2:11; 3:5; 1Â Pet. 4:2; 1Â Jn. 2:16â17). Since flesh often means âmortality,â Adam is spoken of as the âfirst fleshâ upon the earth, meaning he was the first mortal on the earth, all things being created in a nonmortal condition and becoming mortal through the Fall of Adam. Jesus is the âOnly Begotten of the Fatherâ in the flesh, meaning He is the only one begotten of the Father into mortality (Moses 3:7). See also Fall of Adam and Eve.
