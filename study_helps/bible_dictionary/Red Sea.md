Between Egypt and Arabia. Probably best known because it was miraculously parted so that the Israelites under Mosesâ leadership could pass through on dry ground, whereas the armies of Pharaoh were drowned (Ex. 13:18; 14:15â31; Acts 7:36; Heb. 11:29). The parting of the sea by Moses is confirmed in latter-day revelation in 1Â Ne. 4:2; 17:26â27; Hel. 8:11; Moses 1:25. Solomon had a fleet on the Red Sea (1Â Kgs. 9:26).
