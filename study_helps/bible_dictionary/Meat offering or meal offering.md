Hebrew minchah. The English word meat in this context is used in the older sense of âfood.â The Minchah consisted chiefly of grain (or flour and cakes made from grain) and wine, seasoned with salt, and offered with incense. The Minchah could not be offered with a sin offering, but no burnt or peace offering was complete without it. Part was placed on the altar of burnt offering; the remainder was usually eaten by the priests in a holy place (Lev. 6:14â18, 23; Mal. 1:11). It was such an important part of the daily burnt offering that the term is sometimes used to denote the whole morning or evening sacrifice (2Â Kgs. 3:20).
