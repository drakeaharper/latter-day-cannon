---

(1) Son of Gershom, a Levite who hired himself as a house-priest to Micah the Ephraimite (Judg. 17:7â13). Through him idolatrous worship was established in Dan (Judg. 18).

(2) Son of Saul, and friend of David; frequently mentioned in 1Â Sam. 13â23. His friendship for David, whom he might naturally have regarded as a rival, is one of the most unselfish incidents in Old Testament history. He was killed, along with Saul, on Mount Gilboa. Davidâs lamentation over them is among the most beautiful of Bible poems (2Â Sam. 1). Jonathanâs body was rescued from Beth-shan by the men of Jabesh-gilead. He left one son, Merib-baal, afterwards called Mephibosheth.

(3) Davidâs nephew (2Â Sam. 21:21; 1Â Chr. 20:7; 27:32).

(4) Son of Abiathar (2Â Sam. 15:27, 36; 17:17, 20).

(5) Five others (2Â Sam. 23:32; 1Â Chr. 11:34; 27:25; Ezra 10:15; Jer. 37:15, 20).
