---

The fertile plain on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, toward the northern end, 1Â mile broad and 2Â½Â miles long, 500Â feet below the level of the Mediterranean. In our Lordâs day it was considered the best part of Galilee, but it became desolate and uncultivated until the rise of modern Israel (Matt. 14:34; Mark 6:53). The âlake of Gennesaretâ refers to the Sea of Galilee. See Galilee, Sea of.
