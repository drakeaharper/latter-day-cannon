---

The Greek form of the Hebrew word Jezreel. The âgreat plain of Esdraelonâ is also known in the Old Testament as the âvalley of Megiddoâ; it separates the hills of Samaria from those of Galilee and is the most fertile part of Palestine. It was crossed by several important highways and for that reason often provided a battleground (Judg. 4; 5; 7; 1Â Sam. 31; 2Â Chr. 35:20â27; see also Rev. 16:16). See also Armageddon; Megiddo.
