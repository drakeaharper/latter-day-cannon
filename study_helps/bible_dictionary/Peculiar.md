---

Oneâs very own, exclusive, or special; not used in the Bible as odd or eccentric. The Hebrew word segullah, which is translated âpeculiarâ in Deut. 14:2 and 26:18, is translated âspecialâ in Deut. 7:6. Compare the various translations of the same word in Ex. 19:5; Ps. 135:4; Eccl. 2:8; Mal. 3:17. Titus 2:14 and 1Â Pet. 2:9 should carry the meaning of the saintsâ being the Lordâs own special people or treasure.
