---

The book that bears this name is so called from the double numbering or census of the people (Num. 1â4; 26). It contains notices of events in the wilderness, more especially in the second year after the Exodus, and at the close of the wandering, interspersed with legislation. (1) 1:1â10:10, preparation for departure from Sinai. (2) 10:11â14:45, march from Sinai to borders of Canaan; the sending of the spies and their report; the refusal to enter Canaan, and Godâs punishment for disobedience. (3) 15:1â19:22, various laws and historical notices. (4) 20:1â36:13, the history of the last year in the wilderness from the second arrival of the Israelites in Kadesh till they reach âthe plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.â The book is remarkable for the number of fragments of ancient poetry preserved in it (6:24â26; 10:35â36; 21:14â15, 17â18, 27â30). See also Pentateuch.
