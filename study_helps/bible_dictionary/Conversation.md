In the KJV, conversation usually means behavior, way of life, or conduct, rather than the modern sense of talking together. See Ps. 37:14; 2Â Cor. 1:12; Gal. 1:13; Eph. 2:3; 4:22; Philip. 1:27; 1Â Tim. 4:12; James 3:13; 1Â Pet. 1:15, 18; 2:12; 3:1â2; 2Â Pet. 2:7; 3:11. In Philip. 3:20 it probably means citizenship; and in Heb. 13:5, disposition.
