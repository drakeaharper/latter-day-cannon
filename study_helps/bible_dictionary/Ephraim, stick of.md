---

A prophetic reference to the Book of Mormon as a record of one portion of the tribe of Ephraim that was led from Jerusalem to America about 600Â B.C. When joined with the stick of Judah (the Bible), the two records form a unified, complementary testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, His resurrection from the grave, and His divine work among these two segments of the house of Israel. See JSTÂ Gen. 50:24â26, 31 (Appendix); Ezek. 37:15â19; 2Â Ne. 3; 29; D&C 27:5.
