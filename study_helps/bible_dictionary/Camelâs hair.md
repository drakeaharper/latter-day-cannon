---

Camelâs hair is clipped from the animalâs neck, back, and hump and woven into a coarse, durable, rough, and often itchy clothlike material and used for clothing. The camelâs hair garment worn by John the Baptist (Mark 1:6) was possibly used as part of his austerity to separate him from the soft raiment and gorgeous apparel of the kingsâ courts (Matt. 11:8; Luke 7:25) and from the Pharisees and Sadducees.
