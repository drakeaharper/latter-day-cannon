---

The preparation of bodies for burial, for which the Egyptians had an elaborate procedure. Gen. 50:2 (concerning Jacob) is the only detailed reference in the Bible to Israelite use of the Egyptian system, although it is probable that Joseph and others were embalmed in this manner (Gen. 50:26; 2Â Chr. 16:13â14). See also Burial.
