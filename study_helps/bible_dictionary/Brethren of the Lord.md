A title given to James, Joses, Simon, and Judas (Matt. 13:55; see also Matt. 12:46; Mark 6:3; Luke 8:19; John 2:12; 7:3; Acts 1:14; 1Â Cor. 9:5; Gal. 1:19). They were children of Joseph and Mary, born after Jesusâ birth. Matt. 13:56 shows that there were also sisters. The number of girls is not specified, but the Greek text makes it clear that there were more than two. Since the exact number is not known, this is presented in the KJV as âall his sisters.â
