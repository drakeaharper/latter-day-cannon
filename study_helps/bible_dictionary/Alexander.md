---

(1) Son of Simon of Cyrene and brother of Rufus (Mark 15:21).

(2) Acts 4:6; otherwise unknown.

(3) Acts 19:33.

(4) 1Â Tim. 1:20.

(5) 2Â Tim. 4:14. The individuals in the scripture references for numbers 3, 4, and 5 are all connected with Ephesus.

(6) King of Macedon, surnamed the Great; born 356Â B.C., died 323Â B.C. He made himself ruler over a wide empire stretching from Greece to the Indus, including Syria and Egypt. Josephus records a meeting between him and the high priest Jaddua (Neh. 12:11, 22). This story is that Alexander was marching against Jerusalem when the high priest came to meet him in his robes of hyacinth and gold and accompanied by a train of priests and citizens arrayed in white. Alexander was so moved by the solemn spectacle that he did reverence to the high priest, visited Jerusalem, and conferred important privileges on the Jews.
