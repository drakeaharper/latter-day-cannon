Servant of Edom. A Levite belonging to the family of Kohath; called a Gittite because he belonged to the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon. The Ark was kept at his house for six months (2Â Sam. 6:10â12; 1Â Chr. 13:13â14). He was made doorkeeper of the Ark in Zion (1Â Chr. 15:24â25; 16:5, 38). His family kept the temple storehouse (1Â Chr. 26:4, 8, 15; 2Â Chr. 25:24).
