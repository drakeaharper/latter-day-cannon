---

Daughter of Ahab, king of Israel, and his Phoenician wife Jezebel. Athaliah became the wife of Jehoram, king of Judah (2Â Kgs. 8:18, 26; 2Â Chr. 18:1; 21:6), and introduced Baal worship into the southern kingdom as her mother had done in the northern kingdom (2Â Chr. 22:2â4; 24:7). In an effort to solidify her position she destroyed the royal heirs to the throne, but Joash escaped (2Â Kgs. 11:1â3; 2Â Chr. 22:2â12). She met her death by the sword (2Â Kgs. 11:13â20).
