Shoulder. The most ancient of the sacred towns of the children of Israel, situated in a beautiful plain among the mountains of Ephraim, close to the two hills Ebal and Gerizim. It was visited by Abram on his first arrival in the promised land (Gen. 12:6); Jacob bought land here (33:18â19; see also Gen. 35:4; 37:14; Acts 7:16). It was later included in the territory of Ephraim (Josh. 17:7) and became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (20:7; 21:21; 1Â Chr. 6:67). Here Joshua addressed the people (Josh. 24:1), and the bones of Joseph were buried (24:32). Here Rehoboam came to be crowned in the hope of conciliating the northern tribes (1Â Kgs. 12:1; 2Â Chr. 10:1; see also Judg. 8:31; 9:6, 46; 21:19; 1Â Kgs. 12:25; 1Â Chr. 7:28; Ps. 60:6; Jer. 41:5). The modern town of Nablus lies near the ancient site of Shechem.
