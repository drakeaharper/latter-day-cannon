---

These terms denote a return of something that was once present but that has been taken away or lost. It involves, for example, the renewal of the earth to its paradisiacal glory as it was before the Fall of Adam (AÂ ofÂ F 1:10; compare D&C 133:23â24 with Gen. 10:25). In terms of the soul of man it means a return of the individual to the presence of God and includes the reuniting of the physical body with the spirit (see Resurrection). It means a reestablishment of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth in the last days, with the powers, ordinances, doctrines, offices, and all things as they have existed in former ages. It means a gathering together of the house of Israel from its scattered condition. Thus it is frequently spoken of as the restitution (or restoration) of all things, as in Acts 3:19â21. The time in which all these things are accomplished is called the dispensation of the fulness of times (Eph. 1:10; D&C 27:6, 13).
