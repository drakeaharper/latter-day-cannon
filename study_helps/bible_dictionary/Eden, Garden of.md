The home of our first parents, Adam and Eve (Gen. 2:8â3:24; 4:16; Isa. 51:3; 2Â Ne. 2:19â25; Moses 3â4; Abr. 5), designated as a garden, eastward in Eden. Latter-day revelation confirms the biblical account of the Garden of Eden and adds the important information that it was located on what is now the North American continent.
