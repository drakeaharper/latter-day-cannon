---

A skull. The Aramaic name of the place where Christ was crucified (Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22; John 19:17). It is uncertain why it received this nameâpossibly because it was a round bare spot, bearing some likeness to a bald head. It was outside the gate (Matt. 28:11; Heb. 13:12) but close to the city (John 19:20) and to some highway (Mark 15:29). JSTÂ Matt. 27:35 defines Golgotha as âa place of burialâ (see Matt. 27:33 note a).
