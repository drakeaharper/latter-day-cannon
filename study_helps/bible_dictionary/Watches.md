The Jews, like the Babylonians and Greeks, divided the night into three watches, âthe beginning of the watches,â sunset till 10Â p.m. (Lam. 2:19); the âmiddle watch,â 10Â p.m. till 2Â a.m. (Judg. 7:19); and the âmorning watch,â 2Â a.m. till sunrise (Ex. 14:24; 1Â Sam. 11:11; Luke 12:38). The Romans had four watches, and it is their practice that is followed in Matt. 14:25; Mark 6:48; 13:35.
