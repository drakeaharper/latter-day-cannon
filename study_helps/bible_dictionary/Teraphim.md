---

Images of the size and form of a man (1Â Sam. 19:13, 16) used from patriarchal times (Gen. 31:30, 32) and onwards (Judg. 17:5; Hosea 3:4â5; Zech. 10:2) in worship and for magical purposes both in Israel and in Babylon (Ezek. 21:21). To use teraphim was probably not to worship strange gods but to worship the true God in a corrupt manner.
