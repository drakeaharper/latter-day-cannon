---

(1) Son of Terah and brother of Abraham. The father of Lot and also the father of Abrahamâs wife Sarah (Abr. 2:2), he died as the result of a severe famine in Ur of the Chaldees (Gen. 11:26â31; Abr. 2:1).

(2) A Levite (1Â Chr. 23:9).

(3) The place of Abrahamâs (Abramâs) first settlement on leaving Ur of the Chaldees; apparently named in memory of Abrahamâs deceased brother Haran. It was a place of many flocks, and Terah, Abrahamâs father, tarried there. The Lord appeared to Abraham at Haran (Gen. 11:29â32; Abr. 2:4â6). It was in the district near the source of the Euphrates and was a trading center of great importance, frequently mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions. It continued to be a flourishing city for many centuries. Acts 7:2 renders the word âCharran.â
