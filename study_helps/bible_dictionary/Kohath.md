Second of the three sons of Levi, and grandfather of Moses and Aaron (Gen. 46:11; Ex. 6:16, 18). From him all priests were descended through Aaron, while those of his descendants who were not priests were known as Kohathites and were the Levites of highest rank (Num. 3:27, 30; 4:18, 34, 37; 10:21; 1Â Chr. 6:61â70; 15:5).
