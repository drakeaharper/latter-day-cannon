As was the case with many of the ancient prophets, Mosesâ ministry extended beyond the limits of his own mortal lifetime. In company with Elijah, he came to the Mount of Transfiguration and bestowed keys of the priesthood upon Peter, James, and John (Matt. 17:3â4; Mark 9:4â9; Luke 9:30; D&C 63:21; HC 3:387). From this event, which occurred before the Resurrection of Jesus, we understand that Moses was a translated being and had not died as reported in Deut. 34 (Alma 45:19). It was necessary that he be translated, in order to have a body of flesh and bones at the time of the Transfiguration, since the Resurrection had not yet taken place. Had he been a spirit only, he could not have performed the work on the mount of giving the keys to the mortal Peter, James, and John (see D&C 129).

Moses came again to the earth on April 3, 1836, to the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, and conferred the keys of the gathering of Israel upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery (D&C 110), so that the keys of authority would once more be operative among men on the earth.

Latter-day revelation speaks much concerning Moses. He is mentioned frequently in the Book of Mormon, and from the Doctrine and Covenants we learn concerning his ministry (D&C 84:20â26) and that he received the priesthood from his father-in-law Jethro (D&C 84:6). The Lord has also given us the record of several visions of Moses, which greatly enlarges our knowledge of him (Moses 1). The book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price also enriches our appreciation of its author.

Latter-day revelation concerning Moses confirms the biblical account of his greatness, his divine calling, and the events of his ministry and reaffirms that he was the author of the five books that bear his name (1Â Ne. 5:11; Moses 1:40â41). He is one of the greatest of men. For other references see Ps. 103:7; Isa. 63:12; Jer. 15:1; Mal. 4:4; Matt. 23:2; Luke 16:29, 31; John 1:17; 5:46; Acts 7:20â44; 1Â Cor. 10:2; 2Â Tim. 3:8; Heb. 11:23â29; Jude 1:9; Rev. 15:3; 1Â Ne. 4:2; 17:23â30, 42; D&C 8:3; JSâM 1:55.
