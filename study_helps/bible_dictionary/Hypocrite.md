---

The word generally denotes one who pretends to be religious when he is not (though it is sometimes used to mean simply a bad man; see Job 8:13; 13:16; Isa. 9:17; 33:14). Hypocrisy was the besetting sin of the Pharisees and was severely condemned by the Lord (Matt. 23:13â33; Mark 12:38â40; Luke 11:37â44; 20:46â47).
