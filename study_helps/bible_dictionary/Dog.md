Sometimes used for guarding flocks, but usually held in aversion by the Israelites, being regarded as half-wild, greedy creatures, running about at will without a master and acting as public scavengers (Deut. 23:18; 1Â Sam. 17:43; 24:14; 2Â Sam. 3:8; 9:8; 16:9; 2Â Kgs. 8:13; Ps. 59:6; Matt. 7:6; 15:26; Philip. 3:2); the name is applied to false teachers (Isa. 56:10â11; Philip. 3:2; Rev. 22:15); and frequently by Jews to Gentiles (Mark 7:27).
