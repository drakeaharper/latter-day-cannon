Donations for the poor, mentioned frequently in the New Testament (Matt. 6:1â4; Luke 11:41; 12:31â34; Acts 3:3; 10:2; 24:17). Throughout his travels Paul gathered and distributed donations for the needy saints in Jerusalem (Rom. 15:25â27; 1Â Cor. 16:1â2; 2Â Cor. 8:9; Gal. 2:10). This was an organized and united welfare program of the Church. Although not mentioned in the Old Testament as alms, the principle is given in many instances; for example, Deut. 24:19. See also Ps. 41:1; 112:9; Prov. 14:21; 19:17; 22:9; 28:27; Acts 9:36; 11:29â30; Philip. 4:18; 1Â Tim. 6:18â19.
