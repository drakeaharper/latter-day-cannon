Appointed high priest in A.D.Â 7 by the Roman legate Quirinius and deposed in A.D.Â 15 by Valerius Gratus. From A.D.Â 18â36 his son-in-law (John 18:13) Joseph Caiaphas was high priest, and during this time Annas was a person of great influence in the Sanhedrin. Jesus, when arrested, was first brought to him (John 18:13); he also took a leading part in the trial of the Apostles (Acts 4:6). In accordance with Jewish custom he kept the title âhigh priestâ after he was deposed from office.
