---

Part of the dress of the high priest (Ex. 28:6, etc.), shaped like a waistcoat with two shoulder pieces and a girdle. It was of richly variegated material, blue, purple, and scarlet. On the shoulder pieces were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the 12Â tribes. To the ephod was fastened the Breastplate of Judgment. An ephod of linen seems to have become the dress of all priests (1Â Sam. 22:18). It was also worn by Samuel (1Â Sam. 2:18) and by David when he brought up the Ark (2Â Sam. 6:14). The ephod at one time became the object of idolatrous worship (Judg. 8:27; 17:5). The name may possibly in these last passages have been used to denote an image of some kind. See also Gideon.
