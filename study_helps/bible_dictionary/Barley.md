---

A food grain cultivated from the earliest times; in Palestine it is sown from the beginning of November till the beginning of December; the harvest is about three weeks earlier than wheat harvest. Often it was mixed with other, more palatable grains in making flour. See Ex. 9:31; Deut. 8:8; Ruth 1:22; John 6:9â13.
