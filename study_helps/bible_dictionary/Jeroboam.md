---

(1) Son of Nebat (1Â Kgs. 11:26â14:20); the first king of divided kingdom of Israel; a member of the tribe of Ephraim, which led the revolt against the house of Judah and family of David. This revolt seems to have had the approval of the prophet Ahijah (11:29â40), but one of Jeroboamâs first steps after the separation was to set up image worship in Dan and Bethel, the two calves being supposed to be images of Jehovah. This sin made his name proverbial (15:34) and called down on him the rebuke of the prophet Ahijah (14:6â16). He also made priests of men who were not of the family of Aaron (1Â Kgs. 12:31; 2Â Chr. 13:9); he instituted a new feast of his own, and also began the worship of wooden images or Asherah (1Â Kgs. 14:15).

(2) JeroboamÂ â ¡, of the dynasty of Jehu, the ablest of the kings of Israel, and the most successful in war (2Â Kgs. 13:13; 14:16, 23, 27â29; 15:1, 8). Amos and Hosea prophesied during his reign, and denounced the idolatry, licentiousness, and oppression that prevailed throughout the kingdom.
