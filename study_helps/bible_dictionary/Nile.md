Isa. 19:7â8; 23:3, 10; Jer. 46:7â8; Zech. 10:11. KJV has river(s), except in Isa., where it has brooks. The Nile was the sacred river of Egypt, frequently mentioned in the account of the Israelitesâ sojourn there. There being practically no rain in Egypt, the land on either bank is dependent upon the annual flood for water, and the failure of this always causes famine.
