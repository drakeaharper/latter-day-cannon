---

A son of Adam and Eve; a shepherd who offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain (Gen. 4:4; Heb. 11:4) and was killed by him out of jealousy and because Cain lusted after his flocks. Abelâs sacrifice was accepted of the Lord because he was authorized by revelation to make the offering; and he performed it in faith, in the proper manner, by the proper authority, and for the proper reasons, his sacrifice being a type or symbol of the Redeemer (Heb. 11:4; Moses 5:5â8, 17â36; HC 2:15â16; see also JSTÂ Gen. 17:7 [Appendix]; Matt. 23:35; Heb. 12:24; D&C 84:16).
