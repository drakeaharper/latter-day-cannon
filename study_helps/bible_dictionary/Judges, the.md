---

This name was given to a period of history between Joshua and Saul, extending over some 200Ã‚ years, and marked by disorder, idolatry, and foreign oppression. The judge was more than a civil officer. He was generally a military leader as well, and his right to lead rested on the fact that in the eyes of the people he was the strongest and best man for the purpose. Faith in God was always the secret of success; but as a rule the judge was more of a fighter than a preacher.
