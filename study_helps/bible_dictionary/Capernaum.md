Village of Nahum. A town on the northern end of the Sea of Galilee, probably on the site now known as Tell-HÃ»m. At the time of our Lord the district was one of the most prosperous and crowded in all Palestine. Here the Lord lived after the beginning of His ministry, so that Capernaum is called âhis own cityâ (compare Matt. 9:1 with Mark 2:1). It was the home of Peter and Andrew (Mark 1:29) and of Matthew (Matt. 9:9). Many of our Lordâs miracles were worked here (Matt. 8:5, 14; 9:1; Mark 1:21, 30; 2:1; Luke 4:31â35, 38; 5:18; 7:1). In the synagogue at Capernaum was spoken the wonderful discourse found in John 6:59. Later the Lord upbraided the people of the place for their rejection of Him (Matt. 11:23; Luke 10:15).
