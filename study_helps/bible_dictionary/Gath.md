Winepress. One of the five cities of the Philistines (Josh. 11:22); the men of the place were punished on account of the Ark (1Â Sam. 5:8; 6:17; 7:14). It was the birthplace of Goliath (1Â Sam. 17) and a place of refuge for David (1Â Sam. 21:10â15; 27). Afterwards it was captured by David (1Â Chr. 18:1).
