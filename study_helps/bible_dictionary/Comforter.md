Two Comforters are spoken of. The first is the Holy Ghost (John 14:16â27; Moro. 8:26; D&C 21:9; 42:17; 90:11). The Second Comforter is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. âWhen any man obtains this last Comforter, he will have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend him, or appear unto him from time to time, and even He will manifest the Father unto himâ (D&C 88:3â4; 130:3; HC 3:381). See also Holy Ghost.
