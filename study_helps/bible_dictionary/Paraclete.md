The word does not occur in the KJV. It is an English form of the Greek parakletos, a name applied by the Lord (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) to the Holy Spirit and that may be translated Comforter, Advocate, or Helper. The same name is applied by John (1Ã‚ Jn. 2:1) to the Lord Himself. Advocate is probably the English word that most nearly represents the meaning of the Greek.
