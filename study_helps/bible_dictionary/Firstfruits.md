Regarded as belonging to God, and offered by the nation as a whole at the great feasts, and by private individuals at other times (Ex. 22:29; 23:19; 34:26). The prescribed ritual included (1) the waving before the Lord of a sheaf of barley on the morrow of the Passover Sabbath (Lev. 23:10â14); (2) the offering of two loaves made with new wheat flour at the Feast of Pentecost (Ex. 34:22; Lev. 23:15, 17); (3) a thanksgiving for the harvest at the Feast of Tabernacles, or of Ingathering (Ex. 23:16; 34:22; Lev. 23:39). See also Num. 15:19, 21; Deut. 26:2â11. Rules with regard to private offerings of firstfruits are found in Ex. 23:16; Lev. 2:12â16; 19:23â25; 22:14; 23:15â17; Num. 15:19â21; Deut. 18:4; 26:2; 2Â Chr. 31:5, 11; Neh. 10:35, 37; 12:44.
