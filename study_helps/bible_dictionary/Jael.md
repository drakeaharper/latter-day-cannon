Wife of Heber the Kenite (see Kenites), an Arab chief in alliance with the Israelites. Sisera, Jabinâs captain, after his defeat took refuge in Jaelâs tent and was killed by her either while he was drinking, as seems implied by Judg. 5:24â27, or while he lay asleep, according to the prose account in Judg. 4.
