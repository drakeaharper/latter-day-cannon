Also called John; son of Mary, who had a house of considerable size in Jerusalem (Acts 12:12); cousin (or nephew) of Barnabas (Col. 4:10); accompanied Paul and Barnabas from Jerusalem (Acts 12:25) and on their first missionary journey, deserting them at Perga (13:5, 13); accompanied Barnabas to Cyprus (15:37â39); with Paul at Rome (Col. 4:10; Philem. 1:24); with Peter at Babylon (probably Rome) (1Â Pet. 5:13); with Timothy at Ephesus (2Â Tim. 4:11). His gospel (see Gospels) was possibly written under the direction of Peter. His object is to describe our Lord as the incarnate Son of God, living and acting among men. The Gospel contains a living picture of a living Man. Energy and humility are the characteristics of his portrait. It is full of descriptive touches that help us to realize the impression made upon the bystanders. Tradition states that after Peterâs death, Mark visited Egypt, founded the Church of Alexandria, and died by martyrdom.
