Field of blood. The popular name for the field bought with the money returned to the chief priests by Judas (Matt. 27:3â10). From Acts 1:18â19 it appears to have been so called as being the scene of his death. It was afterwards used as a buryingplace for âstrangersâ (Jews of the dispersion and proselytes).
