A procedure used from the earliest times in the manner of blessing, conferring the Holy Ghost, and ordaining to the priesthood. See Gen. 48:14, 17; Num. 27:18, 23; Deut. 34:9; Matt. 9:18; Mark 10:13, 16; Luke 4:40; Acts 6:6; 8:14â17; 9:12, 17; 13:3; 19:1â7; 28:8; 1Â Tim. 4:14; 5:22; 2Â Tim. 1:6; Heb. 6:2; James 5:14â16; Alma 6:1; Moro. 2; D&C 20:41, 58, 68, 70; 36:1â2; AÂ ofÂ F 1:5. Such procedure is in accord with the revealed will of the Lord and is not a mere formality. In latter-day revelation the laying on of hands is discussed by the Lord as follows: âI will lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my SpiritÂ â¦â (D&C 36:2).

The laying on of hands also formed part of the ritual of sacrifice under the law of Moses (Ex. 29:10, 15, 19; Lev. 1:4; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:4; 8:14).
