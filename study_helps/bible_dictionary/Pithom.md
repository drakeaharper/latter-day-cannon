A treasure city of Egypt (Ex. 1:11); discovered by M.Â Naville in 1880, several monuments of interest being now in the British Museum. The store chambers are found to have been built with three kinds of brick, some made with straw, some with reeds or stubble, some with Nile mud alone. The bricks bear the cartouche or oval of RamsesÂ â ¡, who is thus shown to have been the Pharaoh of the oppression.
