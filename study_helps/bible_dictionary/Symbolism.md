The scriptures are rich in symbolism and figurative expression. Ceremonies and ordinances are symbolic in their performance, and all bear record of Jesus Christ (Moses 6:63). Such symbolism is seen in sacrifice (Heb. 9:11â15; Moses 5:7â8); in the sacrament (JSTÂ Mark 14:20â24 [Appendix]; Luke 22:13â20); and in baptism (Rom. 6:1â6; D&C 128:12â13). Biblical names especially are symbolic (see Christ, names of and Names of persons). The tabernacle ceremony was symbolic of eternal things (Heb. 8â10), as was the entire law of Moses, containing types and shadows of Christ (Mosiah 13:29â32; Alma 25:15). For other symbolic items see Ex. 20:8â11; Matt. 5:13â16; Jacob 4:5; Alma 37:38â45.
