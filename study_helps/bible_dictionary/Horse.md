Most of the allusions to horses that occur in the Bible refer to their use in war. They were not used at all by the early Hebrews; Solomon introduced them from Egypt. The Canaanites, in the time of Joshua, made use of war-horses and chariots (Josh. 11:9), but they could only be used in plains and level country. In Job 39:19â25 there is a description of a war-horse. There is only one allusion to the horse being employed for agricultural purposes among the Jews, namely, for threshing grain (Isa. 28:28).
