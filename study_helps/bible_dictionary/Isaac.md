---

He laugheth. The son born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age, the child of promise, and the heir of the promises (Gen. 15:1â6; 17:15â19; 18:9â15; 21:1â8). The main interest of his life gathers around his birth, the sacrifice on Mount Moriah (Gen. 22), his marriage (24; 25), and his dealings with his sons (27; 28). There are numerous references to him in various parts of the Bible (see especially Gal. 4:28; Heb. 11:9, 17, 20). In character he appears to have been a peace-loving shepherd of great personal piety, full of affection for the members of his own family. In D&C 132:37 we are told that Isaac is now exalted and sits upon a throne with Abraham and Jacob (see also Matt. 8:11).
