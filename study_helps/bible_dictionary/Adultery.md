---

The unlawful association of men and women. Although generally having reference to illicit activity of married persons, the scripture often does not distinguish between the married and the unmarried. While adultery is usually spoken of in the individual sense, it is sometimes used to illustrate the apostasy of a nation or a whole people from the ways of the Lord, such as Israel forsaking her God and going after strange gods and strange practices (Ex. 20:14; Jer. 3:7â10; Matt. 5:27â32; Luke 18:11; D&C 43:24â25). Severe penalties were given in the Old Testament for adultery (Lev. 20:10); and unrepentant adulterers will suffer the judgments of God in the world to come (Heb. 13:4; Rev. 18:3â18; D&C 76:103).
