---

A Greek transliteration from the Hebrew Har Megiddon, or âMountain of Megiddo.â The valley of Megiddo is in the western portion of the plain of Esdraelon about 75Â miles north of Jerusalem. Several times the valley of Megiddo was the scene of violent and crucial battles during Old Testament times (Judg. 5:19; 2Â Kgs. 9:27; 23:29). A great and final conflict taking place at the Second Coming of the Lord is called the battle of Armageddon. See Zech. 11â14, especially 12:11; Rev. 16:14â21.
