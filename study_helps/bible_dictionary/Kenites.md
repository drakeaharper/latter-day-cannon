---

Probably a Midianite tribe, descended from Abraham by his wife Keturah. Mosesâ marriage with the daughter of Jethro, a prince and priest of Midian, was also a cause of the long-standing friendship between the Kenites and Israelites (Num. 24:21â22; Judg. 1:16; 4:11, 17; 5:24; 1Â Sam. 15:6; 27:10; 30:29). The Rechabites were a sect or family belonging to this tribe (1Â Chr. 2:55).
