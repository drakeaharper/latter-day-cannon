A city in the Negev, originally assigned to Judah (Josh. 15:31) but transferred to Simeon (Josh. 19:5). It was a Philistine city in the days of Saul and was given by Achish to David (1Â Sam. 27:6). The Amalekites made a raid upon it (1Â Sam. 30:1â26; see also 2Â Sam. 1:1; 4:10; 1Â Chr. 4:30; 12:1, 20; Neh. 11:28).
