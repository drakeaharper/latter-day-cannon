House of mercy or house of grace. Pool at Jerusalem, having five porches or cloisters. It seems to have had medicinal properties, popularly attributed to the âtroublingâ of the waters by an angel (John 5:4). There was possibly an intermittent spring flowing into the pool, which produced a bubbling at the surface. It was here that Jesus healed a man who had been an invalid for 38Â years.
