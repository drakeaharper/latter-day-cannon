A personal, familial term for âfatherâ as used in Hebrew. It is Aramaic for father and in Talmudic times was used as a title of honor. It was used in the language of Jesus and the Apostles, and later by Greek-speaking Christians, as an intimate name for Father in Heaven. See Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6.
