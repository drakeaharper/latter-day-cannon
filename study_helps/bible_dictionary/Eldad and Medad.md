Two of the 70Â elders who assisted Moses in the wilderness. They are mentioned because they received the gift of prophecy in connection with their call, even though they didnât go as appointed to the tabernacle. When Joshua wished Moses to forbid them to prophesy, Moses said, âWould God that all the Lordâs people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!â (Num. 11:24â29).
