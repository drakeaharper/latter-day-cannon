It is impossible to find any natural product that will answer to the requirements of the scriptural narrative in regard to this heavensent food. With regard to the name, we are told (Ex. 16:15) that the people, seeing the small scale-like substance, said one to another, âMan-hu,â âFor they wist not what it was.â This also translates âWhat is it?â See Ex. 16:31â35; Num. 11:7â9; Josh. 5:12; John 6:31â32; 1Â Cor. 10:1â4; Heb. 9:4; Rev. 2:17.
