---

Open-eyed. Son of Remaliah; kills his master Pekahiah and becomes king of Israel (2Â Kgs. 15:25â32; 16:1); invades Judah with Rezin (2Â Kgs. 15:37; 16:5; 2Â Chr. 28:6; Isa. 7:1); Israel invaded by Tiglath-pileser; Pekah killed by Hoshea (2Â Kgs. 15:29â30). There is much difficulty in deciding the chronology of Pekahâs reign. See Bible Chronology in the appendix.
