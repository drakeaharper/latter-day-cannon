Also called En-mishpat (Gen. 14:7) and âthe water of Meribahâ (Num. 20:13), a city in the southwest corner of Palestine, a well-watered and fruitful spot in the wilderness of Zin. (Not to be confused with the city of Kadesh in the north, the site of the great battle between the Egyptians and Hittites, about 1287Â B.C.) Here Miriam died (Num. 20:1), and from here, two years after leaving Egypt, the 12 spies were sent to report upon the land of Canaan (Num. 13:26). On their return, a revolt broke out, and as a punishment the people were condemned by God to wander for 38Â years.
