---

Mary of Magdala, probably the place of that name on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Out of her went seven devils (Luke 8:2). She was near the cross (Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40; John 19:25); at the burial (Matt. 27:61; Mark 15:47); at the tomb in the morning (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:10; John 20:1, 11). Jesus appeared to her (Mark 16:9; John 20:14â18).
