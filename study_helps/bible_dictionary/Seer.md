âA seer is a revelator and a prophet alsoâ (Mosiah 8:15â16), and when necessary he can use the Urim and Thummim or holy interpreters (Mosiah 8:13; 28:16). There have been many seers in the history of Godâs people on this earth but not so many as there have been prophets. âA seer is greater than a prophet â¦ and a gift which is greater can no man haveÂ â¦â (Mosiah 8:15â18). Joseph Smith is the great seer of the latter days. In addition, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators. For other references see 1Â Sam. 9:9; 2Â Sam. 24:11; 2Â Kgs. 17:13; 1Â Chr. 29:29; 2Â Chr. 9:29; 33:19; Isa. 29:10; 30:10; JSTÂ John 1:42 (John 1:42 note a); 2Â Ne. 3:6â14; D&C 21:1; 107:92; 124:94, 125; 127:12; 135:3; Moses 6:36, 38.
