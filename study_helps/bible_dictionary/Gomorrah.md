The early history of Gomorrah is found in Gen. 10:19; 13:10; 14:2â11; 18:20; its destruction is noted in Gen. 19. See also Deut. 29:23; Isa. 13:19; Jer. 50:40; Amos 4:11; Matt. 10:15; Rom. 9:29; 2Â Pet. 2:6; Jude 1:7. The fate of the city was regarded as a warning against sensual wickedness. The five âcities of the plain,â of which Gomorrah was one, probably stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea.
