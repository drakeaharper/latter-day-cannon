(1) Eldest son of Zeruiah, Davidâs sister, and captain of Davidâs army. He was closely associated with all the chief events of Davidâs reign and was generally faithful to his master. After Davidâs death he was in favor of Adonijahâs succession (1Â Kgs. 2:28) and for that reason was put to death by Solomon (2:29â34).

(2) Two others (1Â Chr. 4:14; Ezra 2:6).
