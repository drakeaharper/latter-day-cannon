---

An important seaport town of Palestine, on the main road from Tyre to Egypt, 33Â miles north of Joppa, and about 60Â miles from Jerusalem. Built by Herod the Great, it was the official residence of Festus, Felix, and other Roman prefects and procurators of Judea (Acts 23:23, 33; 25:1â13). Philip worked in Caesarea (Acts 8:40; 21:8, 16). It was there that Cornelius, the gentile centurion, was baptized by Peter (Acts 10:1, 24; 11:11), and that Herod Agrippa died (Acts 12:23). Caesarea is also frequently mentioned in connection with Paulâs journeys (Acts 9:30; 18:22; 21:8, 16; 23:23, 33; 25:1, 4, 6, 13).
