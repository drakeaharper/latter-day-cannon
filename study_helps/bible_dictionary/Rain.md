In Palestine rain begins to fall in October and continues in November and early December (the âearly rainâ). During January and February the vital âwinter rainâ soaks the soil and fills the cisterns. The biblical âlatter rainâ comes in March and April. Showers may occur in May, but after this, rain hardly ever falls until the end of September, though on the high ground the dews at night are often heavy. Some have reasoned that because no rain is mentioned in the Bible until Noahâs day, it therefore did not rain until that time, but see Enochâs discussion of rain in Moses 7:28.
