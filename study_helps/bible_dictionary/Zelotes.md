The Zealot. A name of Simon, one of the Twelve Apostles (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13). Matthew and Mark in their lists call him âthe Cananeanâ (not Canaanite as in the KJV), which is formed from an Aramaic word (Kanan), of which Zelotes is the Greek and Zealot the English equivalent. The Zealots were a party among the Jews (so called from their zeal for the law) who were determined to resist Roman or any foreign authority in Palestine.
