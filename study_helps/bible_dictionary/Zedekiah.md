The Lord (is) righteousness. The last king of Judah, his name changed from Mattaniah to Zedekiah (Jer. 23:6; 33:16). See 2Â Kgs. 24:17â20; 25:2â7; 1Â Chr. 3:15; 2Â Chr. 36:10; Jer. 1:3; 21:1â7; 24:8; 27:3, 12; 28:1; 29:3; 32:1â5; 34:2â8, 21; 37â39; 44:30; 49:34; 51:59; 52.

Book of Mormon references to Zedekiah are many, a notable contribution being the information that not all of the sons of Zedekiah were slain (as implied in Jer. 52:10), for one son, Mulek, came to the Western Hemisphere (Hel. 8:21). See also 1Â Ne. 1:4; 5:12â13; Omni 1:15; Hel. 6:10.
