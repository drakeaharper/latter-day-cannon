---

Occurs in the Bible only in Rev. 1:10. The first day of the week is meant, being the day of our Lordâs Resurrection and also the day on which the Holy Spirit came upon the Apostles. References to its weekly observance are found in Acts 20:7; 1Â Cor. 16:1â2; and in many early Christian writers. It was never confounded with the Sabbath, but carefully distinguished from it (Col. 2:16). The term is used also in D&C 59:9â13.
