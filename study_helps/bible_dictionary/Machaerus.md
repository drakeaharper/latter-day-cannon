A fortress in Perea above the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea. It is not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but Josephus (Antiquities, 18.5.1â2) mentions it as the place where John the Baptist was imprisoned and beheaded, as in Matt. 14:10â11 and Mark 6:17â28. Some ruins still remain at the site.
