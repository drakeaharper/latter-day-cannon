The Law ordered that a yearling lamb, with its proper meal and drink offerings, should be offered every morning and every evening as a burnt offering (Ex. 29:38â42). This was never omitted, at least in later times, except in the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes and for about three weeks before the taking of Jerusalem by Titus. In the Holy Place, every morning and evening, incense was burnt upon the altar of incense (Ex. 30:7â8). There was also a meal offering twice every day, probably in connection with the daily burnt offering (Lev. 6:20). The offering of the daily sacrifices was accompanied with (1) music, vocal and instrumental (2Â Chr. 29:27â28); (2) worship and prayer on the part of the people present (2Â Chr. 29:28; Luke 1:10; Acts 3:1); (3) psalms, one being appointed for each day in the week: Ps. 24, 48, 81, 82, 92, 93, 94. Besides the public offerings, numerous private offerings were daily made. In later times daily offerings were also made on behalf of the gentile authorities, the kings of Persia (Ezra 6:9â10), the kings of Syria, and the Roman emperors and Roman people.
