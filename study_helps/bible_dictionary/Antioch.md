(1) In Syria, an important city on the Orontes, founded 300Â B.C. by Seleucus Nicator; in New Testament times the third city in the Roman Empire. It was the chief meeting point of East and West and a most disreputable city. During Paulâs life it was a center of gentile Christianity (Acts 6:5; 11:19â30; 13:1; 14:26; 15:22â35; 18:22; Gal. 2:11).

(2) In Pisidia, a Phrygian city in the Roman province of Galatia (Acts 13:14; 14:19â21; 2Â Tim. 3:11).
