Ewe. The younger of the daughters of Laban, the dearly loved wife of Jacob, and mother of Joseph and Benjamin (Gen. 29â31; 33:1â2, 7; 35:16, 24â25; 46:19, 22, 25); her grave (35:19â20; 48:7; 1Â Sam. 10:2). Jeremiah, in a very beautiful passage, pictures Rachel as weeping in Ramah for her children, the descendants of Benjamin, Ramah being the place at which the exiles were assembled before their departure for Babylon (Jer. 31:15). Matthew quotes the passage in his description of the mourning at Bethlehem (where Rachelâs grave was) after the murder of the children (Matt. 2:18).
