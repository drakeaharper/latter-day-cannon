(Modern Jaffa.) A town on the southwest coast of Palestine, the nearest port to Jerusalem (called âJaphoâ in Josh. 19:46). It became a place of importance as a harbor in Solomonâs reign (2Â Chr. 2:16; see also Ezra 3:7; Jonah 1:3; Acts 9:36â43; 10:5, 8, 23, 32; 11:5). In New Testament times it was the only town on the coast that was more Jewish than Gentile.
