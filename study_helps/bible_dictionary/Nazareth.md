Early home of Jesus (Matt. 2:23; 4:13; Luke 1:26; 2:4, 39; 4:16). The village lies in a hollow among the hills of Galilee, just above the Plain of Esdraelon, and near several of the main roads of that region. It was in the synagogue at Nazareth that the Lord declared Himself to be the fulfiller of the prophecy in Isa. 61:1â2. See Luke 4:16â30; see also Matt. 13:54; Mark 6:1. After His rejection on that occasion the Lord does not appear ever to have visited the place again.
