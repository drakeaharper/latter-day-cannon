Entry: Lordâs Prayer

---

So called because it was taught by our Lord to His disciples. Matthew (6:9â13) includes it in the Sermon on the Mount, while Luke (11:1â5) tells us that it was given by our Lord in answer to a request from one of His disciples. There are some small differences in the form in which the two disciples have recorded the prayer; these may be accounted for by supposing that they themselves did not always use exactly the same words in saying the prayer. A slightly different rendition is found in 3Â Ne. 13:9â13; and further variations are to be seen in JSTÂ Matt. 6:9â15 (see Matt. 6:13 note a).
