The inscription interpreted by Daniel (Dan. 5:25â28). It can be literally translated ânumbered, numbered, weighed, and divisions.â Possibly the words are names of weights, âa mina, a mina, a shekel, and a half.â Danielâs skill showed itself in his giving to these words an interpretation bearing on the circumstances of the time. In the interpretation (verseÂ 28) peres is found instead of upharsin. The u in upharsin is simply âand.â Parsin (which is written pharsin when a vowel precedes) is the plural of peres (pronounced so as to rhyme with deface). Mene should be pronounced so as to rhyme with bewray, and tekel with bewail.
