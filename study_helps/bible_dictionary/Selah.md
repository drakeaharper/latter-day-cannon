(1) Ancient capital of Edom (2Â Kgs. 14:7; Isa. 16:1); rendered âthe rockâ in Judg. 1:36; 2Â Chr. 25:12; Obad. 1:3. It was afterwards known as Petra. There are still important buildings there belonging to the Roman period.

(2) A musical term that occurs 71 times in the Psalms and three times in Habakkuk. Its meaning is uncertain. Most likely it is a direction to the musicians to strike up, either with a louder accompaniment or with an interlude while the singing ceased.
