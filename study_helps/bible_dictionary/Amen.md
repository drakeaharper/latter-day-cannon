Firm, true. The word is used to denote acceptance (Deut. 27:15â26) or truthfulness (1Â Kgs. 1:36). Amen was the proper response of a person to whom an oath was administered (1Â Chr. 16:36; Neh. 5:13; 8:6). Christ is called âthe Amen, the faithful and true witnessâ (Rev. 3:14; see also John 14:6; 1Â Cor. 14:16; 2Â Cor. 1:20).
