---

The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined. Without this there can be no progress in the things of the soulâs salvation, for all accountable persons are stained by sin and must be cleansed in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. Repentance is not optional for salvation; it is a commandment of God (D&C 18:9â22; 20:29; 133:16). The preaching of repentance by John the Baptist formed the preparation for the ministry of our Lord. See Matt. 3:2; 4:17; Mark 1:4, 15; 2:17; Luke 3:3, 8; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 8:22; Rom. 13:11â14; James 5:1â6; Rev. 2:5, 16; 3:3, 19; see also Isa. 1:16â20; Jer. 3â5; 26; Ezek. 18:19â31; 33:7â20; Hosea 6; 12; 14; Joel 1:8; 2; Jonah 3:5â10; Zeph. 2; Zech. 1; Mal. 1â4.
