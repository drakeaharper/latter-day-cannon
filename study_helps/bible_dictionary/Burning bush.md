---

A bush in which the Lord appeared to Moses when He gave him his commission to bring Israel out of Egypt (Ex. 3:2â4). Although the bush burned, it was not consumed, and this circumstance caught Mosesâ attention. The event was referred to by Jesus in speaking to the Sadducees (Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37). Stephen also makes mention of it (Acts 7:30). In latter-day revelation the experience is verified in Moses 1:17.
