---

A pole or stick with a sharp metal point, used to prick oxen while plowing. Reference is made to it in Acts 9:5. Judg. 3:31 records that Shamgar slew 600Â men with his ox goads. After entering Canaan, the Israelites employed the Philistine metal smiths to sharpen their goads and other tools (1Â Sam. 13:19â21). Words of counsel from the wise are goads to right conduct in Eccl. 12:11.
