Men of Gergesa (Matt. 8:28). There is a difference of opinion as to the scene of the healing of the man with an unclean spirit; see Gadara. Gadara and Gerasa were well-known places, and these names might easily be substituted for the less well-known Gergesa, where the miracle was almost certainly worked, near the middle of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee; the modern name is Khersa.
