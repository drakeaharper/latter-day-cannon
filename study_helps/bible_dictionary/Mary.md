(1) Mother of Jesus. The virgin, cousin of Elisabeth (Luke 1:36); betrothed to Joseph (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:27); the Annunciation (26â38); visits Elisabeth (40â45); magnifies the Lord (46â55); returns (56); Joseph warned not to put her away (Matt. 1:18â25); goes to Bethlehem with Joseph (Luke 2:4â5); the Nativity (7, 16); visit of the shepherds (16â20); the Purification (2:21â38); the Magi visit (Matt. 2:11); in Egypt (13â14); returns to Nazareth (19â23; Luke 2:39); goes up to the Passover (41â52); at the wedding at Cana (John 2:2â5). Other references during our Lordâs ministry include Matt. 12:46; 13:54â55; Mark 3:31â32; 6:3; Luke 8:19. She was entrusted to John (John 19:25â26) and was with the Apostles after the Ascension (Acts 1:14). There is no trustworthy history of her later years. Latter-day revelation confirms the biblical account and affirms that Mary was a pure and a chosen vessel and the mother of the Son of God in the flesh (1Â Ne. 11:13â20; Mosiah 3:8; Alma 7:10).

(2) Sister of Lazarus and Martha. Sat at Jesusâ feet (Luke 10:39, 42); sent for Jesus after the death of Lazarus (John 11:1â45); anointed Jesus with ointment (John 12:3â8).

(3) The mother of James and Joses, at the cross (Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40); perhaps the same Mary called the wife of Cleophas (John 19:25); at the burial (Matt. 27:61); âthe other Maryâ (Mark 15:47); at the tomb in the morning (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:10).

(4) Mother of Mark (Acts 12:12).
