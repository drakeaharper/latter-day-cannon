The Bible is family oriented. The first man and womanâAdam and Eveâwere a family. When they were cast out of the Garden of Eden, Adam ate his bread by the sweat of his brow; and Eve, his wife, labored with him (Moses 5:1). All the early recorded events in the life of Adam and Eve show them doing things together (see, for example, Moses 4 and 5). The history of Israel begins with the family of Abraham. He is highly esteemed of the Lord as a father and teaches his children properly (Gen. 18:17â19). Family life is safeguarded with such divine commandments as Ex. 20:12, 14â17; 21:15â17. The frequent genealogical lists in the scriptures give evidence of the importance that is placed on family. The book of Proverbs offers many instructions directed toward the family, such as Prov. 13:1, 22; 15:5, 20; 19:13, 26.

Jesusâ teachings were directed to a family type of life, as in Matt. 5:45; 10:21; 13:57; 19:3â9; Mark 10:2â9; Luke 6:36; 15:31; John 19:27. The Lord frequently referred to His Father and emphasized the âFatherlinessâ of God. Paul and Peter gave much counsel about the duties of husbands and wives, parents and children (Eph. 6:1â4; Col. 3:18â21; 1Â Pet. 3:1â7).

Latter-day revelation confirms all that the Bible teaches about the family and adds the most important truth that through the gospel of Jesus Christ the family can be sealed together in a permanent relationship for time and all eternity (D&C 132).
