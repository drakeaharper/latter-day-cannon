---

Used for sacrifice and also kept for their milk. The hair was used to make the curtains of the tabernacle, the skin was made into a vessel for carrying water, and the flesh was eaten. Wild goats are also mentioned in the Old Testament. They are still found in the ravines of Moab and in the wilderness of Judea near the Dead Sea.
