---

Six cities, three on each side of Jordan (that is, Kedesh, Shechem, and Hebron, on the western side, and Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan on the eastern side), in which a man who had accidentally committed homicide could take refuge from the avenger of blood. The regulations about the use of these cities are found in Num. 35:6â34; Deut. 19:1â13; Josh. 20.
