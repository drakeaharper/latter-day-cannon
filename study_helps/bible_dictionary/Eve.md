---

The name given in Gen. 2:21â22; 3:20 to the first woman; see also Gen. 3; 4:1; 2Â Cor. 11:3; 1Â Tim. 2:13. The name means âthe mother of all livingâ (Moses 4:26; see also 1Â Ne. 5:11). She was the wife of Adam and will share eternal glory with him. Eveâs recognition of the necessity of the Fall and the joys of Redemption is recorded in Moses 5:11. Latter-day revelation confirms the biblical account of Eve and gives us an awareness of her nobility.
