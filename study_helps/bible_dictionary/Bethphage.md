House of figs. A village or district near Bethany to which Jesus sent disciples to obtain a donkey on which He could ride in the triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:1; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:29). Its site has never been exactly determined, but it is near the Mount of Olives and the road from Jericho.
