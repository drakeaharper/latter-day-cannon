---

The word denotes a tenth part, given for the service of God. The first recorded instance is the payment made by Abraham to Melchizedek (Gen. 14:20; Heb. 7:4â10). See also Jacobâs vow (Gen. 28:22). The law enforced the payment and provided rules with regard to the use to which the tithe should be put. In Num. 18:21â28 it is directed that tithe be paid to the Levites, who in their turn give one-tenth of what they receive to the priests.

A clear exposition of the tithe is given in Mal. 3:8â18, in which it is shown that blessings from the payment of tithing are both temporal and spiritual, and failure to pay an honest tithe is a form of robbery. The importance of Malachiâs words is demonstrated by the fact that the Lord repeated them to the Nephites (see 3Â Ne. 24).

Latter-day revelation emphasizes the law of the tithe as a duty and a test of faithfulness (D&C 64:23â25; 85:3; 97:11; 119). The honest payment of tithing sanctifies both the individual and the land on which he lives. See also Lev. 27:30â34; Deut. 12:5â18; 14:22â27; 2Â Chr. 31:5â12; Neh. 10:38; 12:44; 13:12.
