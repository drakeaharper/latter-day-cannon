The valley of Hinnom. South of Jerusalem, the scene of Moloch worship (2Â Chr. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31; 19:2â6); polluted by Josiah (2Â Kgs. 23:10); afterwards a place in which the refuse of the city was burned, and for that reason it was symbolic of the place of torment after death (see Matt. 5:29â30; 10:28; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45; Luke 12:5; James 3:6).
