God hath helped. (1) Third son of Aaron (Ex. 6:23); admitted to priestly office (Ex. 28:1). Eleazar and Ithamar were Aaronâs chief assistants after the death of Nadab and Abihu by fire (Lev. 10:12, 16; see also Num. 20:25â29; Deut. 10:6; Josh. 14:1; 24:33). All the high priests until the Maccabean period were descended from Eleazar, with the exception of those from Eli to Abiathar, inclusive, who belonged to the family of Ithamar.

(2) Son of Abinadab, who took charge of the ark at Kirjath-jearim (1Â Sam. 7:1).

(3) One of Davidâs three mighty men (2Â Sam. 23:9).

(4) Three others (1Â Chr. 23:21â22; Ezra 8:33 and Neh. 12:42; Ezra 10:25).
