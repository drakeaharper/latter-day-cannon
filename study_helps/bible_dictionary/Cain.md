---

A son of Adam and Eve who slew his younger brother Abel over jealousy and greed (Gen. 4:1â16). Some of his descendants were skilled in the use of the harp and organ and in working with brass and iron (Gen. 4:17â25). Due to the incompleteness of the biblical record, many have regarded Cain as the eldest son of Adam. However, latter-day revelation tells us that Adam and Eve had many sons and daughters before Cain was born (Moses 5:1â3, 16â18). He married one of his brothersâ daughters (Moses 5:28).

Cainâs offering was rejected by the Lord, probably for several reasons, including the fact that it was not done in faith nor in the prescribed and revealed manner (compare Moses 5:5â8 with Gen. 4:3â5). He entered into an unholy covenant with Satan by which he became known as Master Mahan, or âmaster of this great secret,â and by which he could âmurder and get gainâ (Moses 5:29â31). A mark was set upon him by which he could be distinguished from the other children of Adam (Gen. 4:15; Moses 5:38â41). Cain and his descendants lived separately from the other descendants of Adam (Moses 7:22).

Cain is mentioned frequently in the scriptures, including Heb. 11:4; 1Â Jn. 3:12; Jude 1:11; Hel. 6:27; Ether 8:15; Moses 5â7; see also D&C 84:16.
