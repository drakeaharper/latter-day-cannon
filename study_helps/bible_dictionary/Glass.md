Made and used by the Egyptians, Hebrews, and other early races. In the Revelation of John it is an emblem of brightness (Rev. 4:6; 15:2; 21:18). The âglassâ mentioned in the New Testament as an instrument for reflection (1Â Cor. 13:12; 2Â Cor. 3:18; James 1:23) was a mirror made of polished metal.
