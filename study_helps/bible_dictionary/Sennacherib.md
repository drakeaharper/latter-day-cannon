King of Assyria, 705â681Â B.C. Upon his accession, Hezekiah, king of Judah, tried to throw off the Assyrian yoke. Sennacherib accordingly invaded Judah and took some of the fenced cities (2Â Kgs. 18:13; 2Â Chr. 32:1; Isa. 36:1); sent messengers from Lachish, demanding Hezekiahâs subjection (2Â Kgs. 18:17; 2Â Chr. 32:9; Isa. 36:2); sent another letter (2Â Kgs. 19:9; 2Â Chr. 32:17; Isa. 37:9); his army was destroyed (2Â Kgs. 19:35; 2Â Chr. 32:21; Isa. 37:36); he was slain by his sons (2Â Kgs. 19:37; 2Â Chr. 32:21; Isa. 37:38). See Assyria and Babylonia.
