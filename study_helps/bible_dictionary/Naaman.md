Syrian noble cured of leprosy by Elisha (2Â Kgs. 5; Luke 4:27). He came to Elisha at the suggestion of a little Hebrew maid, captured in war (2Â Kgs. 5:2â3). He was ordered to bathe seven times in the Jordan, which, after some hesitation, he did and was cured. He showed his gratitude by returning to Samaria, a distance of 30Â miles, to thank Elisha. The prophet refused to accept any payment, and his servant Gehazi was punished for taking Naamanâs present. Naaman took with him to Syria two mulesâ burden of earth (2Â Kgs. 5:17), on which he intended to erect an altar to Jehovah. He did this because he believed that the God of Israel could only be worshipped on Israelite soil.
