Snakes marked with flamelike spots, or whose bite caused acute inflammation (Num. 21:6). The Lord sent these upon the children of Israel to âstraiten them,â and He prepared a way that those who were bitten might be healed by looking at the serpent of brass that Moses raised up before them, which was a symbol of the Redeemer being lifted upon the cross (John 3:14â15). The event is confirmed in latter-day revelation (1Â Ne. 17:41; 2Â Ne. 25:20). See also Serpent, brazen.
