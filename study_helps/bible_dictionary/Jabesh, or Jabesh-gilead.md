Jabesh means âdry.â A chief city of Gilead, east of the Jordan, connected with several important events of Israelite history (Judg. 21:8â14; 1Â Sam. 11; 31:11â13; 2Â Sam. 2:4â5; 21:12; 15:10â14). It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who took Saulâs body down from the walls of Beth-shan and buried it under an oak tree in Jabesh-gilead (1Â Chr. 10:11â12).
