Might, strength. In Hebrew and related languages it designates âthe divine being.â Many biblical names employ El with other words, such as Bethel (âthe house of Godâ), Eleazar (âGod has helpedâ), Michael (âwho is like Godâ), Daniel (âa judge is Godâ), Ezekiel (âGod will strengthenâ), and Israel (âto prevail with Godâ or perhaps âlet God prevailâ). Possibly the best known use of El is in Elohim, a plural form signifying the âalmightyâ or âomnipotent,â a name applied to the Father.
