---

Name of a Philistine god. Used as a title for the âchief of the demons,â or Satan. The Pharisees referred to him as the âprince of the devilsâ (Matt. 12:24). Jesus denied that He cast out devils by the power of Beelzebub (Luke 11:14â20). See also 2Â Kgs. 1:1â6, where it is spelled Baalzebub.
