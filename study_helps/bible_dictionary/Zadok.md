Righteous. The priest (2Â Sam. 8:17; 15:24â36; 17:15; 18:19, 27; 19:11; 20:25). He belonged to the family of Eleazar (1Â Chr. 6:4â8). During the latter years of Saulâs reign there seems to have been a double high priesthood: Abiathar, who belonged to the family of Ithamar, officiating in Davidâs camp, and Zadok at Gibeon, where the tabernacle was standing. This arrangement continued after Davidâs accession, but during the rebellion of Adonijah, Abiathar joined the rebels, while Zadok remained faithful to David (1Â Kgs. 1:8, 26). He anointed Solomon (1:32â45); and was finally put in the room of Abiathar. See 1Â Kgs. 2:35; 4:2, 4; 1Â Chr. 6:8, 53; 12:28; 15:11; 16:39; 18:16; 24:3, 6, 31; 27:17; 29:22; 2Â Chr. 31:10; Ezra 7:2; Ezek. 40:46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11. He is probably the same as in 1Â Chr. 6:12; 9:11; Neh. 11:11; others are in 2Â Kgs. 15:33; 2Â Chr. 27:1; Neh. 3:4, 29; 10:21; 13:13.
