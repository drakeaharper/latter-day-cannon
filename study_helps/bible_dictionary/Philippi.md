---

A city of Macedonia, founded by Philip, father of Alexander the Great; visited by Paul (Acts 16:12â40; 20:6; see also Philip. 1:1; 1Â Thes. 2:2). It is described as a Roman âcolonyâ; it contained a body of Roman citizens, placed there for military purposes, governed directly from Rome and independent of provincial governors and local magistrates. The church there was mainly gentile, there being no Jewish synagogue. Paulâs visit was memorable for his assertion of his rights as a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37). The converts were afterwards generous in their contributions toward his support (Philip. 4:15).
