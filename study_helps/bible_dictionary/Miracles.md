An important element in the work of Jesus Christ, being not only divine acts, but forming also a part of the divine teaching. Christianity is founded on the greatest of all miracles, the Resurrection of our Lord. If that be admitted, other miracles cease to be improbable. Miracles should not be regarded as deviations from the ordinary course of nature so much as manifestations of divine or spiritual power. Some lower law was in each case superseded by the action of a higher. They were intended to be a proof to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ (Matt. 11:4â5; John 2:11; 10:25; 20:30â31). Many of them were also symbolic, teaching such divine truths as the result of sin and the cure of sin; the value of faith; the curse of impurity; and the law of love. The miracles of healing also show how the law of love is to deal with the actual facts of life. Miracles were and are a response to faith and its best encouragement. They were never wrought without prayer, felt need, and faith.

It is important to notice the different names by which miracles are described. They are called signs, as being visible tokens of an invisible power; they are powers or mighty works, because they are the acts of One who is almighty; they are simply works, or the natural results of the Messiahâs presence among men; they are wonders, marvels, because of the effect produced on those who saw them. The following miracles are found in one Gospel only:

Matthew. (1) The curing of two blind men (9:27â31); (2) the casting out of a devil from the dumb man (9:32â34); (3) a piece of money in the fishâs mouth (17:24â27).

Mark. (1) The healing of a deaf and dumb man (7:31â37); (2) the restoration of the sight of the blind man at Bethsaida (8:22â26).

Luke. (1) The draught of fishes (5:4â11); (2) the raising of the widowâs son (7:11â16); (3) the healing of the woman with a spirit of infirmity (13:11â17); (4) the healing of the man afflicted with dropsy (14:1â6); (5) the cleansing of the 10 lepers (17:12â19); (6) the healing of Malchus (22:50â51).

John. (1) Water made wine (2:1â11); (2) the healing of the noblemanâs son (4:46â54); (3) the healing of the impotent man at Bethesda (5:1â16); (4) the restoration of sight to the man blind from birth (John 9); (5) the raising of Lazarus (11:1â45); (6) the net full of fishes (21:1â24).

Miracles are a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If miracles cease it is because faith has ceased. See Mark 6:5â6; Morm. 9:10â20; Ether 12:12.
