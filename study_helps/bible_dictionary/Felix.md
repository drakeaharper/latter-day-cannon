Procurator of Judea at the time of Paulâs arrest by the Roman military authorities (Acts 23:24). He investigated the case and heard Paul speak in his own defense (Acts 24) but put off giving any decision, his reason being that he had âmore exact knowledge concerning the Wayâ: he knew more about the case and about Christianity than the prosecutors had told him. He hoped Paul would have offered him some bribe; but none being offered on his recall from Judea, he left the Apostle still in prison. See Drusilla; see also Bible Chronology in the appendix.
