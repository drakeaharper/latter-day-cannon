South and west of Jerusalem, it was the scene of the idolatrous worship of the fire-god Moloch (2Â Chr. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31; 32:35; see also 2Â Kgs. 16:3; 21:6), and was afterwards used as a place of refuse (2Â Kgs. 23:10â14). In New Testament times it was called Gehenna and was regarded by the Jews as symbolic of the place of torment.
