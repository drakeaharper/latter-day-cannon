Fisherâs town (sometimes spelled Sidon). In ancient times it was the most important city of Phoenicia (hence Phoenicians are generally called Zidonians in the Old Testament). It was on the border of Asher (Josh. 19:28) but was never occupied by that tribe (Judg. 1:31). The town is now known as Saida, midway between Tyre and Beyrout (Beirut).
