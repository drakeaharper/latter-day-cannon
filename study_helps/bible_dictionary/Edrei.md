(1) A city of Og, king of Bashan, east of the river Jordan, in territory allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Num. 21:33; Deut. 1:4; 3:1, 10; Josh. 12:4; 13:12, 31). Modern explorations have discovered on the ancient site (now called EdraÊ¼ah) an elaborately contrived subterranean city, with streets, shops, and marketplace.

(2) A town allotted to Naphtali (Josh. 19:37).
