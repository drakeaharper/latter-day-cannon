The garden, across the brook Kedron, on the slope of the Mount of Olives, to which the Lord went on leaving the upper room on the night of His betrayal (Matt. 26:36; Mark 14:32; Luke 22:39; John 18:1). An old tradition identifies it with a garden still existing some 250Ã‚ yards from the east wall of the city.
