---

Father of excellence, or plenty. A son of the high priest Ahijah or Ahimelech, he escapes Saul (1Â Sam. 22:20); abides with David (23:6, 9; 30:7); brings the ark back to Jerusalem (2Â Sam. 15:24â36; 17:15; 19:11); takes part in Adonijahâs rebellion (1Â Kgs. 1:7); is thrust out from the priesthood (2:27, 35; Mark 2:26). Ahimelech and Abiathar are probably interchanged in 2Â Sam. 8:17; 1Â Chr. 18:16; 24:3, 31. See also 2Â Sam. 20:25.
