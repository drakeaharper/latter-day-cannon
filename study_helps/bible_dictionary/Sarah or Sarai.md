Sarah means âprincess.â The wife of Abraham. From Gen. 11:29â17:15 the form of the name used is Sarai (which possibly means âcontentions,â or more probably is another form of Sarah). She was married to Abraham before he left Ur. In her old age she became the mother of Isaac (Gen. 21:2). She died before her husband and was buried in the cave of Machpelah at Hebron (Gen. 23:2). See also Isa. 51:2; Rom. 4:19; Heb. 11:11; 1Â Pet. 3:6.
