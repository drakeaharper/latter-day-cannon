---

A vehicle, generally used for purposes of war (Ex. 14:7; Josh. 17:18; Judg. 1:19; 4:3; 1Â Sam. 13:5). Up to the time of David the Israelites had few chariots (1Â Sam. 8:11â12); in later times a regular force was maintained (2Â Sam. 8:4; 1Â Kgs. 10:26). The armies that fought against Israel also had chariots, such as the Syrians (2Â Sam. 8:4; 2Â Kgs. 8:21), the Assyrians (2Â Kgs. 19:23), and the Persians (Isa. 22:6â7). The Israelite fighting chariot was probably after the Egyptian model, the plan of which is known from Egyptian paintings and reliefs still in existence.
