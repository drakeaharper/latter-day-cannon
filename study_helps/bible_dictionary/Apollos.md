---

An Alexandrian Jew, an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures (Acts 18:24â19:1). He received instruction in the gospel at Ephesus from Aquila and Priscilla and then went to Corinth; his name was afterwards connected with one of the disputes that arose there (1Â Cor. 1:12; 3:4â6, 22; 16:12). We afterwards hear of him in Crete (Titus 3:13).
