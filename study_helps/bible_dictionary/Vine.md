Palestine has always been famous for its vines (Deut. 8:7â8). The growing of grapes was part of the regular occupation of the Israelites after the settlement in Canaan. The vine was frequently regarded as a symbol of the Jewish or Christian Church (Ps. 80:8â17; Isa. 5:1â7; 27:2â3; Jer. 2:21; Ezek. 19:10â14; Matt. 21:33â40; Mark 12:1â9; Luke 20:9â16; see especially John 15:1â8).
