---

The scene of our Lordâs conversation with the woman of Samaria (John 4:1â42); a well of the same name still exists, 75Â feet deep, near Nablus, the ancient Shechem, close to the main road from Judea to Galilee. Shechem was Jacobâs home for some years after his return from Laban (Gen. 33:18; 37:12).
