---

One of the ingredients in the anointing oil (Ex. 30:24), and an article of merchandise imported into Tyre by Greek merchants (Ezek. 27:19). There is another Hebrew word also rendered cassia (Ps. 45:8). Both Hebrew words denote aromatic plant products; the former is a cinnamon, while the latter may be Indian orris or costus.
