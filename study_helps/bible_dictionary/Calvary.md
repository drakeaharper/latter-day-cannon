A skull. The name by which the KJV (Luke 23:33) denotes the place where our Lord was crucified. Calvary is merely an English form of the Latin word calvaria, which is itself a translation of the Hebrew word Golgotha, âa skull.â The popular expression âMount Calvaryâ is not warranted by any statement in the Gospels. There is no mention of a mount in any of the narratives of the Crucifixion. See Golgotha.
