---

Of great importance in Palestine owing to the want of rain during a large portion of the year; hence spoken of as a source of fertility (Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13); and in poetry as typical of any beneficial effect produced by quiet means (Deut. 32:2; Ps. 110:3; 133:3; Prov. 19:12; Song 5:2; Isa. 18:4; 26:19; Hosea 6:4; 13:3; 14:5; Micah 5:7).
