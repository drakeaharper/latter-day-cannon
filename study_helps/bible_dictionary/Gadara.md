Called in the New Testament âthe country of the Gadarenes,â Gadara was a city of Decapolis, southeast of the Sea of Galilee, on the main road to Damascus. The people were partly Greek and partly Syrian. The district is mentioned in Mark 5:1 and Luke 8:26, 37, in connection with the healing of a man with an unclean spirit; but the Gospels and the Greek manuscripts do not agree as to its name. Compare the above passages with Matt. 8:28. The miracle was probably worked near Gergesa.
