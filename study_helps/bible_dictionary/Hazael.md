King of Syria from about 886 to 840Â B.C. Frequently mentioned in the lives of Elijah and Elisha (1Â Kgs. 19:15, 17; 2Â Kgs. 8:8â14). He became king by murdering his master Benhadad (2Â Kgs. 8:15) and soon started on a war with Israel and Judah for the possession of Ramoth-gilead (8:28â29; 9:14â15). We learn from Assyrian inscriptions that he was attacked and defeated in Damascus by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria; but a few years later he was again strong enough to attack Israel (2Â Kgs. 10:32; 12:17â18; 13:3â7, 22; 2Â Chr. 24:24).
