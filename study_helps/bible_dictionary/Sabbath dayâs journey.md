---

The distance it was supposed that the law allowed a man to walk on the Sabbath; the rabbis, by means of a forced and unnatural interpretation of Ex. 16:29, fixed this at 2,000 cubits, being the distance between the Ark and the people during the march in the wilderness (Josh. 3:4), and also, according to tradition, the distance between the tabernacle and the furthest part of the camp. See also Acts 1:12.
