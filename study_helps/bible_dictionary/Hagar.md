Flight. An Egyptian handmaid of Sarah and mother of Abrahamâs son Ishmael (Gen. 16; 21:9â21; 25:12). After the birth of Isaac, the âchild of promise,â Hagar and her son were expelled. Paul uses the story as an allegory to show the difference between the two covenants, the one a covenant of bondage and the other one of freedom (Gal. 4:24).
