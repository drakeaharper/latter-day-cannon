Permitted under some circumstances because of the hardness of the peopleâs hearts, but as explained by Jesus, âfrom the beginning it was not soâ (Matt. 19:3â12). Regulation concerning divorce under the law of Moses is found in Lev. 21:14; Deut. 22:19, 29; 24:1â4. In the New Testament there are instructions relating to divorce in Matt. 5:31â32; 19:3â12; Mark 10:2â12; Luke 16:18; 1Â Cor. 7:10â17.
