---

Also Yavneh or Javneh. A place near Joppa where, about A.D.Ã‚ 90, a council of rabbis declared the Old Testament canon to be completed. It is probable that the measure was partly defensive, precipitated by the increasing number of books being written by Christians. Traditionally, at this council the canon of the Old Testament was decided upon which eventually became known as the Masoretic text. See also Canon; Masoretic text.
