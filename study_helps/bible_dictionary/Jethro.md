Also called Jether and Reuel, a prince and priest of Midian who gave Moses a home after his flight from Egypt and afterwards became his father-in-law (Ex. 3:1; 4:18; 18:1â12). It was from Jethro that Moses received the Melchizedek Priesthood (D&C 84:6â7). He also gave Moses some practical advice about administrative delegation of responsibility (Ex. 18:13â27).
