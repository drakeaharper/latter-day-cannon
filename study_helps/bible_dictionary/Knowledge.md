One of the attributes of God (Isa. 46:9â10; Acts 15:18; 2Â Ne. 9:20). Knowledge of divine and spiritual things is absolutely essential for oneâs salvation; hence the gospel is to be taught to every soul. âHow shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?â (Rom. 10:14). Knowledge is not obtained all at once, even by revelation, but line upon line, precept upon precept (Isa. 28:9â10). The scriptures, and also living prophets, are given so that the people might have knowledge of things of God and âknow how to worship, and know what you worshipâ (D&C 93:19). Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost (John 14:26; 16:13; D&C 34:10; 121:26â33) and one of the gifts of the Spirit (1Â Cor. 12:8; Moro. 10:10; D&C 46:18). Peter lists knowledge along with faith, patience, kindness, and virtue as necessary acquisitions for one who would seek for a divine nature (2Â Pet. 1:3â9). Since no one can be saved in ignorance of the gospel (D&C 131:6), and one progresses only as fast as he gains knowledge (HC 4:588), it follows that the person who gains knowledge will have âthe advantage in the world to comeâ (D&C 130:18â19).

Other references showing the importance of gaining knowledge are Prov. 1:20â33; 3:13â26; 4:1â13; 8; 15:14; 24:3â4; John 17:3; Philip. 3:8; 2Â Ne. 32:7.
