The Arabic Esdud, seat of the worship of Dagon (1Â Sam. 5:1â9). Though allotted to Judah (Josh. 15:46â47) and occasionally held by kings of Judah (2Â Chr. 26:6), it remained a Philistine city (Neh. 4:7; Amos 1:8). It was on the main route from Egypt to Phoenicia, midway between Gaza and Joppa. See Philistines.
