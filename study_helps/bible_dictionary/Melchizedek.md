King of Righteousness. A notable prophet and leader who lived about 2000Â B.C. He is called the king of Salem (Jerusalem), king of peace, and âpriest of the most High God.â Unfortunately, information concerning him in the Bible is relatively scarce, being limited to Gen. 14:18â20; Heb. 5:6; 7:1â3. Mention of the priesthood of Melchizedek is given in several other instances, primarily in Psalms and in Hebrews. However, latter-day revelation gives us much more about him and his priesthood (see JSTÂ Gen. 14:17 [Gen. 14:18 note d]; JSTÂ Gen. 14:25â40; JSTÂ Heb. 7:3 [Appendix]; Alma 13:14â19; D&C 84:14; 107:1â4). From these sources we realize something of the greatness of this prophet and the grandeur of his ministry. See also Jebus; Jerusalem; Melchizedek Priesthood.
