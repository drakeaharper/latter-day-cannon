---

An aromatic gum or spice used for healing wounds (Gen. 43:11; Jer. 8:22; 46:11; 51:8). A bush producing the resin from which the balm was made grew so plentifully in Gilead in Old Testament times that the balm came to be known as the âbalm of Gileadâ and was exported to Tyre and Egypt (Gen. 37:25; Ezek. 27:17).
