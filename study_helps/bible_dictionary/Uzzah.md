Strength. Slain for touching the Ark (2Â Sam. 6:6); called Uzza (1Â Chr. 13:9). The penalty may appear to us severe, but it must be remembered that the Ark was a sacred repository, and the people had been clearly warned that only designated persons could touch the Ark, and warned also of the consequences of disobedience.
