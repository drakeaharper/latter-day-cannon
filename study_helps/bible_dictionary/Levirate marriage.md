---

The custom of a widow marrying her deceased husbandâs brother or sometimes a near heir. The word has nothing to do with the name Levi or the biblical Levites but is so called because of the Latin levir, meaning âhusbandâs brother,â connected with the English suffix -ate, thus constituting levirate. This system of marriage is designated in Deut. 25:5â10 (see also Gen. 38:8), is spoken of in Matt. 22:23â33; it also forms a major aspect of the story of Ruth (Ruth 4:1â12).
