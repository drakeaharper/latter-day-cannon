---

An officer of the Roman army, in command of a century, or company of 100 men, forming one-sixtieth part of a Roman legion. In New Testament times the legions were not up to their full strength, and a century varied from 50 to 100 men. At least five centurions are mentioned in the New Testament, of which perhaps the best known is Cornelius (Acts 10:1â35). See also Matt. 8:8â10; 27:54; Mark 15:39; Luke 7:1â9; 23:47; Acts 27:1; 28:16.
