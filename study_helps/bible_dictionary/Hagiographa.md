A Greek word meaning âsacred writings.â Although the word Hagiographa does not occur in the English Bible, it is used frequently in commentary and historical works, having reference to the third division of the Old Testament, commonly called the Writings. It consists of the books of Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, EzraâNehemiah, and Chronicles, making 11 in all (in Hebrew Bibles EzraâNehemiah are counted as one book, as are 1Â and 2Â Chronicles).
