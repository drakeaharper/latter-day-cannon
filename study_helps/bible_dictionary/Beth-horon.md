House of caves. The pass of Beth-horon was part of the vital road from Jerusalem to the sea. The lower end widens out into the valley of Ajalon. The area has seen many battles, including the defeat of the Amorites by Joshua assisted by a hailstorm (Josh. 10:8â11). See also 1Â Sam. 13:18; 2Â Chr. 25:13.
