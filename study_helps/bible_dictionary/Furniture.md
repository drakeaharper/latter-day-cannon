Traditionally, not much furniture was required in Middle Eastern homes because people usually squatted or sat cross-legged on the ground or on a mat or cushion. Even in a palace the furniture of a room consisted only of a few mats or rugs, the divan or row of cushions against the wall, and some low, moveable tables. At the entrance there was usually a fountain at which guests could wash off dust. In a humbler house, instead of the fountain there was a basin and ewer, while instead of rugs and cushions there were mats and shawls. In our Lordâs time the Roman practice had come in of lying on couches at meal times, supported on one elbow, with a cushion under the arm to relieve the pressure. When the company was large the couches would be arrayed in the form of a horseshoe. The occupants reclined with their heads near the edge of the table and their feet sloping outwards, so that the feet might be washed without the table being disturbed (Luke 7:38). Except in winter people freely slept in the open air, but raised bedsteads were also found in most houses (Mark 4:21).
