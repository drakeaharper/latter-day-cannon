Sister of Herod Agrippa; married to her uncle, Herod Philip, by whom she had a daughter Salome (Matt. 14:6). She eloped in order to live as the wife of her step-uncle, Herod Antipas. It was for his rebuke of this crime that John the Baptist was put to death (Matt. 14:8â11; Mark 6:24â28; Luke 3:19).
