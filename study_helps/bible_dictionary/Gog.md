---

(1) A Reubenite (1Â Chr. 5:4).

(2) King of Magog, whose invasion of Israel was prophesied by Ezekiel (Ezek. 38â39). The prophecy points to a time when the gentile nations of the north would set themselves against the people of God and would be defeated and led to recognize Jehovah as King. All this appears to be at the Second Coming of the Lord. Another battle, called the battle of Gog and Magog, will occur at the end of the 1,000Â years. This is described by John in Rev. 20:7â9; see also D&C 88:111â16.
