Usury sometimes has more than one meaning. In biblical English it often means simply charging interest on a loan. At other times it implies an unduly high rate of interest. Under the law of Moses, Israel was forbidden to charge usury, as in Ex. 22:25; Lev. 25:35â38; Deut. 23:19â21; Neh. 5:1â13; Ezek. 18:8; 22:12. The restriction, however, seems to be when lending to a fellow church member. There is no clear restriction against charges for loans to others. Jesus gives some credence to interest charges in Matt. 25:14â30; Luke 19:12â27. Latter-day revelation does not contain restrictions against interest charges.
