A province in the southeast of Asia Minor, separated from Cappadocia by the Taurus range, the pass through which was known as the Cilician Gates. Its capital was Tarsus, the birthplace of Paul (Acts 21:39). Cilicia contained large settlements of Jews (Acts 6:9); it was visited by Paul on several occasions (Acts 9:30; 15:23, 41; 27:5; Gal. 1:21).
