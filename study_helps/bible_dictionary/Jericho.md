---

A walled city in the valley of the Jordan, 800Â feet below the Mediterranean, near the place where the Israelites crossed the river on their first entry into the promised land (Josh. 2:1â3; 3:16; 6). Joshua placed a curse upon it (Josh. 6:26), which was afterwards fulfilled (1Â Kgs. 16:34). It was within the territory assigned to Benjamin (Josh. 18:12, 21) and was visited by our Lord on His last journey to Jerusalem (Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35; 19:1).
