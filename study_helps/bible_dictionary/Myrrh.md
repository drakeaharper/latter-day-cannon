Used in the preparation of the holy ointment (Ex. 30:23); in the purification of women (Esth. 2:12); as a perfume (Ps. 45:8; Song 1; 3â5); and for embalming (John 19:39). It was obtained from various thorny shrubs of the dry districts of Arabia and eastern Africa. In Gen. 37:25; 43:11, myrrh is the gum of the rock rose.
