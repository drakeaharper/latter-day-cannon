Honored of God. The son of a Greek father and Jewish mother (Eunice) living at Lystra (Acts 16:1â3; 2Â Tim. 1:5); circumcised by Paul in order that he might be of greater use for evangelistic work among Jews (Acts 16:3); spoken of by Paul as his own âson in the faithâ (1Â Tim. 1:2, 18; 2Â Tim. 1:2); at Philippi (Philip. 2:22); at Beroea (Acts 17:14); sent to Thessalonica (1Â Thes. 3:2); with Paul at Corinth (1Â Thes. 1:1; 2Â Thes. 1:1); sent to Macedonia (Acts 19:22); to Corinth (1Â Cor. 16:10); with Paul in Macedonia when he wrote 2Â Cor. 1:1, 19; and at Corinth (Rom. 16:21); followed him to Troas (Acts 20:4â5); at Rome (Philip. 1:1; 2:19; Col. 1:1; Philem. 1:1); at Ephesus (1Â Tim. 1:3); Paul wished him to come to Rome (2Â Tim. 4:9, 21); set at liberty (the details of the imprisonment are unknown) (Heb. 13:23). Timothy was perhaps Paulâs most trusted and capable assistant, as in Philip. 2:19â23.
