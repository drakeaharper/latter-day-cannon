Two Hebrew words are thus rendered though they are sometimes translated whale, serpent, jackal, or sea-monster. Probably a large snake or snakelike animal in Deut. 32:33; Ps. 74:13; 91:13. A jackal in Job 30:29; Isa. 13:22; 27:1; 34:13; 35:7; 43:20; 51:9; Jer. 9:11; 10:22; 51:34; Mal. 1:3. Used figuratively in Ezek. 29:3. In the New Testament it is always used figuratively, as in Rev. 12:3, 7, 9, 13, 16; 13:2, 4, 11; 16:13; 20:2; see also Mosiah 20:11; Alma 43:44.
