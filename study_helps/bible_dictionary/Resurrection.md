The Resurrection consists in the uniting of a spirit body with a body of flesh and bones, never again to be divided. The Resurrection shall come to all, because of Christâs victory over death. Jesus Christ was the first to be resurrected on this earth (Matt. 27:52â54; Acts 26:23; 1Â Cor. 15:23; Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5). Others had been brought back from death but were restored to mortality (Mark 5:22â43; Luke 7:11â17; John 11:1â45), whereas a resurrection means to become immortal, with a body of flesh and bone.

All will not be raised to the same glory in the Resurrection (1Â Cor. 15:39â42; D&C 76), nor will all come forth at the same time (see 1Â Cor. 15:23; Alma 40:8). Christ was first; the righteous have precedence over the wicked and come forth in the First Resurrection, whereas the unrepentant sinners come forth in the last resurrection (Rev. 20:5â13).

The New Testament gives ample evidence that Jesus rose with His physical body: He ate fish and honey (Luke 24:42â43); He said He had flesh and bones (Luke 24:39); the people touched Him (Luke 24:39â40; John 20:25â29); the tomb was empty (Luke 24:2â3; John 20:1â10); and the angels said He had risen (Mark 16:1â6).

One of the most fundamental doctrines taught by the Twelve was that Jesus was risen from the tomb, with His glorified, resurrected body, as in Acts 1:21â22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33. To obtain a resurrection with a celestial, exalted body is the center point of hope in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Resurrection of Jesus is the most glorious of all messages to mankind.

Latter-day revelation confirms the reality of the Resurrection of Christ and of all mankind, as in Alma 11:41â45; 40; 3Â Ne. 11; D&C 76; Moses 7:62.
