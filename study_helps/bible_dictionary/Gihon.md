(1) A river of Eden (Gen. 2:13).

(2) A place containing a spring near Jerusalem, where Solomon was anointed king (1Â Kgs. 1:33, 38, 45; 2Â Chr. 32:30; 33:14). The valley in which Gihon was situated was probably the bed of the Kedron, or valley of Jehoshaphat. The waters of the spring flowed through Hezekiahâs tunnel to the pool of Siloam, within the city (2Â Kgs. 20:20). See Hezekiahâs Tunnel.
