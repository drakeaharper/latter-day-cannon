Made by Moses at Godâs command to be a sacramental means of healing for the Israelites in the wilderness (Num. 21:9). It seems to have been carefully preserved and became an object of superstitious worship (2Â Kgs. 18:4); it was accordingly destroyed by Hezekiah, who called it âNehushtan.â The âlifting upâ of the serpent in the wilderness is referred to by the Lord as a type of His own âlifting upâ upon the cross (John 3:14â15). Latter-day revelation confirms the episode of the fiery serpents and the healing properties associated with looking upon Mosesâ brazen serpent (1Â Ne. 17:41; 2Â Ne. 25:20; Alma 33:19â22; 37:46).
