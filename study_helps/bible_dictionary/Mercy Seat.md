The golden covering of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. It was the place of the manifestation of Godâs glory and His meeting place with His people (Ex. 25:22; Lev. 16:2; Num. 7:89); and was regarded as the Throne of God (Num. 7:89; see also Ex. 30:6; 1Â Sam. 4:4). Here the blood of the sin offering was sprinkled on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:14â15). See Tabernacle.
