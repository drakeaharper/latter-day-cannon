---

The region that lay north of Achaia and south of what are now called the Balkan Mountains. It was the first part of Europe in which Paul preached the gospel (Acts 16:9â10) and contained many well-known places, such as Neapolis, Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Macedonia and Thessaly together constituted a Roman Province under the government of a proconsul, who lived at Thessalonica.
