Very common in Palestine; first mentioned in Gen. 8:8â12; a pair of doves or two pigeons were allowed as substitute in some of the offerings for a lamb or kid in the case of poor persons (Lev. 1:14; 5:7; Luke 2:24); it was also the Nazariteâs offering (Num. 6:10). In Song 2:12 and Jer. 8:7 its migratory habits are mentioned; in Ps. 74:19 it is an emblem of affection and timidity; and in Matt. 10:16, of harmlessness. See also Dove, sign of; Turtle.
