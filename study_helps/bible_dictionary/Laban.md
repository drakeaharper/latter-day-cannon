---

Son of Bethuel, grandson of Nahor, grandnephew of Abraham, brother of Rebekah, and father of Leah and Rachel. His branch of the family remained at Haran when Abraham moved on into Canaan. The dealings between the two branches are described in Gen. 24; 27:43â31:55. Jacob lived with him and served him for 20Â years. There was a good deal of mutual deception, each trying to outdo the other; but the final parting among the mountains of Gilead was a friendly one.
