---

(1) High priest and judge, a descendant of Aaron through Ithamar, his younger son. He was probably the first high priest of this line, and the office remained in his family till the deprivation of Abiathar (1Â Kgs. 2:26â27), when it passed back to the family of Eleazar, Aaronâs eldest son. He is chiefly known to us through his connection with the early history of Samuel (1Â Sam. 1â4). The blot on his character was his toleration of the wickedness of his own sons.

(2) My God. (Matt. 27:46.) Mark 15:34 renders the word Eloi, which is perhaps a Galilean form.
