---

A prophet of Judah. The date of his prophecy is uncertain; it may have been spoken as early as the reign of Joash, before 850Â B.C., or even so late as after the Return. The occasion of the prophecy was a severe visitation of drought and locusts. He assures the people that on repentance they will again receive the blessings of God. His prophecy of the outpouring of the Spirit (2:28â32) was quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:17), and by the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith (JSâH 1:41). There are also traces of Joel in Revelation.
