The word saint is a translation of a Greek word also rendered âholy,â the fundamental idea being that of consecration or separation for a sacred purpose; but since what was set apart for God must be without blemish, the word came to mean âfree from blemish,â whether physical or moral. In the New Testament the saints are all those who by baptism have entered into the Christian covenant (see Acts 9:13, 32, 41; Rom. 1:7; 1Â Cor. 1:2; Philip. 1:1; 1Â Pet. 1:14â15). See also Holiness.
