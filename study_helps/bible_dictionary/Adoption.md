There are two types of adoption spoken of in the scriptures. A person who is of non-Israelite lineage becomes a member of the house of Israel through faith in Jesus Christ when it is accompanied by baptism in water and the reception of the Holy Ghost. In addition, all candidates for the fulness of salvation are accounted as sons and daughters of Jesus Christ, being His children by obedience to the gospel (Mosiah 5:7â8). Although the word adoption is not actually used by John the Baptist, he taught the concept as recorded in Matt. 3:9 and Luke 3:8 (compare JSTÂ Matt. 3:36 [Appendix]; JSTÂ Luke 3:8 [Luke 3:8 note d]). See also Rom. 8:15â17; Gal. 4:5â7; Eph. 1:5; Abr. 2:10.
