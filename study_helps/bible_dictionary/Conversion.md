Denotes changing oneâs views, in a conscious acceptance of the will of God (Acts 3:19). If followed by continued faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism in water for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, conversion will become complete and will change a natural man into a sanctified, born again, purified personâa new creature in Christ Jesus (see 2Â Cor. 5:17). Complete conversion comes after many trials and much testing (see Luke 22:32; D&C 112:12â13). To labor for the conversion of oneâs self and others is a noble task, as in Ps. 51:13; Dan. 12:3; James 5:19â20; Alma 26; D&C 18:15â16.
