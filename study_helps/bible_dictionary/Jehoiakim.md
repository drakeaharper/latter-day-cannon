---

The Lord raiseth up. King of Judah (609â598Â B.C.), originally called Eliakim (2Â Kgs. 23:34â36; 24:1â6, 19; 1Â Chr. 3:15â16; 2Â Chr. 36:4â5, 8; Jer. 1:3; 22:18, 24; 26:1, 21â23; 27:1, 20; 28:4; 35:1; 36:1, 9, 28â32). Jehoiakim was son of Joash, king of Judah, and brother of Zedekiah. He was not a faithful ruler; an interesting event is told of him burning the manuscript of one of the prophecies of Jeremiah (Jer. 36:1â26), whereupon Jeremiah wrote the prophecy again. Jehoiakim was given a dishonorable burial of an ass (Jer. 22:18â19). He was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, who in turn was succeeded by Zedekiah. See Bible Chronology in the appendix.
