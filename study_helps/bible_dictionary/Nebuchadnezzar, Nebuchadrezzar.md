Or Nabu-kudur-usur. Nebo, protect the crown! (or, the landmark). The great king of Babylon (604â561Â B.C.), son of Nabopolassar, the founder of the empire (see Assyria and Babylonia); defeats Necho, king of Egypt, at Carchemish and drives the Egyptians from Syria (Jer. 46:2â12); subdues Judah (2Â Kgs. 24:1); besieges Jerusalem (24:10â11) and takes it, carrying away the king and people (25:1, 8, 22; 1Â Chr. 6:15; 2Â Chr. 36; Ezra 1:7; 2:1; 5:12, 14; 6:5; Neh. 7:6; Esth. 2:6; Jer. 27:6, 8, 20; 28:3, 11, 14; 29:1, 3; 34:1; 39:5). For his relations with Daniel, by whom his dreams were interpreted, see Dan. 1â5. He was for a time smitten with madness and on his recovery acknowledged Godâs power and goodness.
