---

A mountain, 9400Â feet high, in the extreme northeast of the Holy Land, being the southern point of a range of hills called Anti-Libanus. It is visible not only from a great part of Galilee, but also from various places as far south as Jericho. The Hermonites (Ps. 42:6) are the three peaks of Mount Hermon. Jewish poetry contains several allusions to this mountain (Ps. 89:12; 133:3; Song 4:8). It is possible that our Lordâs Transfiguration took place either on Hermon or on Mount Tabor (see Matt. 16:13â17:2).
