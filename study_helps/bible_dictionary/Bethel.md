House of God. (1) Formerly called Luz (Gen. 28:19), on the border between Benjamin and Ephraim, and one of the most sacred spots in Israel. Here Abraham built his altar on his first arrival in Canaan (Gen. 12:8; 13:3); here Jacob had his dream, set up a pillar, and gave the place its name (28:19). It was a sanctuary in the days of Samuel (1Â Sam. 7:16; 10:3). Jeroboam selected it as one of the places in which to set up the calf worship (1Â Kgs. 12:29â32; 2Â Kgs. 10:29; Amos 7:13). See also 1Â Kgs. 13; 2Â Kgs. 23:4, 15â30; Hosea 12:4.

(2) Josh. 12:16; 1Â Sam. 30:27.
