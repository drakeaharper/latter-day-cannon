---

Place where was found Nimrodâs kingdom (Gen. 10:10) and the tower of Babel (11:2). Amraphel was king of Shinar (14:1), and Judah was carried captive there (Isa. 11:11; Dan. 1:2; Zech. 5:11). The name denotes the lower part of the district between the Tigris and Euphrates, and is sometimes used as an equivalent for Babylonia.
