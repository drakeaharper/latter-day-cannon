---

A reference to the Bible as a record of the house of Judah (Ezek. 37:15â19). See also Ephraim, stick of. In the last days, when the various branches of the house of Israel are gathered, their sacred records will also be gathered together. These scriptural records complement one another and form a unified testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the God of Israel and the God of the whole world. See also JSTÂ Gen. 50:24â36 (Appendix); 2Â Ne. 3; 29.
