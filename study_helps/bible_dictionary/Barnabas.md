Son of consolation. A name given to Joseph, a Levite of Cyprus, who sold his possessions and gave the proceeds to the Apostles (Acts 4:36â37); was of service to Saul after his conversion (9:27); was sent by the Apostles to Antioch, where he worked with Saul (11:22â30; 12:25); with Paul on missionary journey (Acts 13â14); and at Jerusalem (Acts 15); they parted (15:39). See also 1Â Cor. 9:6; Gal. 2:1, 9, 13; Col. 4:10. Though not one of the Twelve, he was regarded as an Apostle (Acts 14:4, 14).
