Of the firstborn, see Firstborn; of land, see Jubilee, Year of; of a slave, Lev. 25:48. The word is of constant use in the New Testament in speaking of the sacrificial work of Jesus Christ and our deliverance from sin. He redeemed us with His blood (Acts 20:28; Eph. 1:7, 14; Col. 1:14; Heb. 9:11â15; 1Â Pet. 1:18â19; 3:18; Rev. 5:9).
