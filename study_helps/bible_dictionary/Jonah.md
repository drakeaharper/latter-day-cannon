Of Gath-hepher in Zebulun. He lived under JeroboamÂ â ¡, whose success in restoring the ancient boundaries of Israel he predicted (2Â Kgs. 14:25). The present book of Jonah does not claim to be from the hand of the prophet; it describes an episode in his life and is due to some later writer. The key to the book is to be found in Jonah 3:10â4:11 in the reasons the prophet gives for his flight and unwillingness to preach at Nineveh. The writer is opposing a narrowmindedness that would confine the love of God to a single nation. He shows that Jehovah reigns everywhere, over sea and land; even in the gentile world the minds of men are conscious of sin and prepared to acknowledge that Jehovah is God. The book is a beautiful poem, whether it paints the humanity of the gentile sailors; the mourning of the prophet over the decay of the grass of the field; or the divine tenderness in ministering to the prophet with his imperfect conceptions or in pitying the little children of Nineveh. The story of Jonah was referred to by our Lord on two occasions when He was asked for a sign from heaven. In each case He gave âthe sign of the prophet Jonah,â the event in that prophetâs life being a foreshadowing of Jesusâ own death and resurrection (Matt. 12:39â41; 16:4; Luke 11:29â30).
