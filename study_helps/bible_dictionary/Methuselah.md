---

Son of Enoch and the longest lived of the patriarchs (Gen. 5:21â27; Luke 3:37). Some details of his life and ministry are given in latter-day revelation, from which we learn that he was a righteous man, a prophet, and an astronomer and was left on the earth when the city of Enoch was taken to provide a posterity through which Noah would come. See D&C 107:50, 52â53; Moses 8:1â3.
