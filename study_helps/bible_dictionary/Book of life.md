Spoken of in Philip. 4:3; Rev. 3:5; 13:8; 17:8; 20:12; 21:27; 22:19; see also Dan. 12:1â4; Luke 10:20. In one sense the book of life is the sum total of oneâs thoughts and actionsâthe record of his life. However, the scriptures indicate that a heavenly record is kept of the faithful, whose names are recorded, as well as an account of their righteous deeds (D&C 88:2; 128:7).
