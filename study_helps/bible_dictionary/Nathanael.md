God has given. His friendship with Philip and call to be a disciple are found in John 1:45â51; see also 21:2, where we learn that he belonged to Cana in Galilee. He is generally identified with Bartholomew, on the ground that Nathanael is always mentioned along with Apostles, as though of apostolic rank, and that whereas the Synoptists (Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:14) mention Bartholomew (associating him with Philip) and never Nathanael, John mentions Nathanael and never Bartholomew.
