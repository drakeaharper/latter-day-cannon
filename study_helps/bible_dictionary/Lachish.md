A city of the Amorites, between Hebron and the coast (Josh. 10:3, 5, 23, 31â35; 12:11); afterwards included in Judah (15:39); fortified by Rehoboam (2Â Chr. 11:9); here Amaziah was killed (2Â Kgs. 14:19; 2Â Chr. 25:27). It was captured by Sennacherib (2Â Kgs. 18:17; 2Â Chr. 32:9), and the siege is depicted on an Assyrian monument still in existence. After the Return Lachish was again occupied by Jews (Neh. 11:30).
