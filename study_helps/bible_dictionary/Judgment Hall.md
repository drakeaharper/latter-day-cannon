Sometimes used in the KJV for the Latin word Praetorium. In John 18:28, 33; 19:9, it denotes Pilateâs official residence in Jerusalem; in Acts 23:35 it denotes a part of the buildings erected by Herod in Caesarea. In Matt. 27:27 praetorium is translated âcommon hallâ or âgovernorâs houseâ (Pilateâs house); in Philip. 1:13 it is translated âpalaceâ or âCaesarâs court,â meaning the officers of the court before which Paul was tried.
