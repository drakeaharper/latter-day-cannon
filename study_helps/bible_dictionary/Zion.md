The word Zion is used repeatedly in all the standard works of the Church and is defined in latter-day revelation as âthe pure in heartâ (D&C 97:21). Other usages of Zion have to do with a geographical location. For example, Enoch built a city that was called Zion (Moses 7:18â19); Solomon built his temple on Mount Zion (1Â Kgs. 8:1; see also 2Â Sam. 5:6â7); and Jackson County, Missouri, is called Zion in many of the revelations in the D&C, such as 58:49â50; 62:4; 63:48; 72:13; 84:76; 104:47. The city of New Jerusalem, to be built in Jackson County, Missouri, is to be called Zion (D&C 45:66â67). The revelations also speak of âthe cause of Zionâ (D&C 6:6; 11:6). In a wider sense all of North and South America are Zion (HC 6:318â19). For further references see 1Â Chr. 11:5; Ps. 2:6; 99:2; 102:16; Isa. 1:27; 2:3; 4:3â5; 33:20; 52:1â8; 59:20; Jer. 3:14; 31:6; Joel 2; Amos 6:1; Obad. 1:17, 21; Heb. 12:22â24; Rev. 14:1â5; and many others. (In the New Testament, Zion is spelled Sion.)
