---

A kind of wild marjoram, used at the Passover (Ex. 12:22); for sprinkling purposes in the purification of lepers (Lev. 14:4, 51) and in the sacrifice of the red heifer (Num. 19:6; see also 1Â Kgs. 4:33; Ps. 51:7). According to John (19:29), the sponge with the vinegar offered to our Lord on the cross was âput upon hyssop.â Matthew and Mark do not mention the hyssop but only the reed by which it was raised to Jesusâ mouth.
