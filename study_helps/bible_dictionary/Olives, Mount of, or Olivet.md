---

A limestone hill east of Jerusalem, with the Kidron valley lying between. On its western side lay the garden of Gethsemane, and on the east, Bethphage and Bethany. This mount not only was the place of many happenings in biblical times, but shall also be prominent in events of the latter days and the Messiahâs Second Coming (Zech. 14:4â5; D&C 45:48; 133:20).
