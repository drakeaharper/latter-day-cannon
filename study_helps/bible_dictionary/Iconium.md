A town of Asia Minor, on the high tableland north of the Taurus mountains, on the borders between Phrygia and Lycaonia. It was visited by Paul on his first missionary journey (Acts 13:51â52; 14:1â6, 19, 21); also probably on the second and third journeys (Acts 16:2; 18:23). His sufferings there were long remembered (2Â Tim. 3:11).
