---

An Arab tribe that lived in the desert of Paran between the Arabah and the Mediterranean and at one time seem to have ranged as far north as Mount Ephraim (Judg. 5:14; 12:15). The Amalekites were at constant war with the Hebrews from the time of Moses (Ex. 17:8, etc.) till their power was broken by Saul and David (1Â Sam. 15; 27:8; 30; 2Â Sam. 8:12), and their last remnant was destroyed by the Simeonites (1Â Chr. 4:43).
