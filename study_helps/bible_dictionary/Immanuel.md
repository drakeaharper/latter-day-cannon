God with us. Also spelled Emmanuel. A name-title given in Isa. 7:14 and 8:8 as a sign of Godâs deliverance. Alluded to in Micah 5:2â3. Specifically identified by Matthew (Matt. 1:18â25) as a prophecy of Jesusâ birth into mortality. It signifies that Christ as God will be born into mortality of a virgin and will be among the people to save and redeem them. This prophecy received its fulfillment in Christ. The name appears in latter-day revelation in 2Â Ne. 17:14; 18:8; D&C 128:22.
