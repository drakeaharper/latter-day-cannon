---

Son of Jephunneh, of the tribe of Judah; one of the princes or heads of tribes sent by Moses to search the land of Canaan in the second year after the Exodus. He and Joshua alone brought back a true report (Num. 13:6, 30; 14:6â38); they alone of all the people who left Egypt survived the 40Â years in the wilderness (Num. 26:65; 32:12; Deut. 1:36). After the entrance into Canaan, Caleb obtained Hebron (Josh. 14:6â14; 15:13â19; 21:12; Judg. 1:12â15, 20; 3:9); this district was still in the possession of his family in the time of David (1Â Sam. 25:3; 30:14).
