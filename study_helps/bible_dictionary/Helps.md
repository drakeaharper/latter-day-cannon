In Acts 27:17 the word denotes cables passed around the hull of a ship and tightly secured on deck to prevent the timbers from starting, especially amidship, where in ancient ships with one large mast the strain was very great. The technical English word to describe the operation is frapping. In 1Ã‚ Cor. 12:28 the word is used in describing the gifts of the Spirit and denotes administrative offices, programs, and other like provisions placed in the Church, designed to assist the members to obey the commandments and strengthen one another.
