Also called Sea of Chinneroth, and the Lake of Gennesaret or Tiberias; pear-shaped, 12Â½Â miles long, and 7Â½Â miles across at its greatest breadth. It lies 680Â feet below sea-level; the heat is very great, and the cold air rushing down from the hills often produces sudden storms (see Luke 8:22â24). The river Jordan flows right through it, from north to south. In the Lordâs time there were nine cities on the shore of the lake, including Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Gergesa, each with a population of over 15,000. The lake and its shores were crowded with busy workers. The best fishing ground was at the north end, and a large quantity of pickled fish was exported to all parts of the Roman Empire.
