A town of Libya, on the northern coast of Africa, containing a large Jewish settlement, the home of Simon, who bore our Lordâs cross (Matt. 27:32). Jews from here were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:10); its Christian converts took an active part in missionary work at Antioch (Acts 11:20; 13:1).
