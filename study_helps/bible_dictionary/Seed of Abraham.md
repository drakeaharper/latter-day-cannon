---

The heirs of the promises and covenants made to Abraham and obtained only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Men and women become heirs by faithfulness to covenant obligations whether they are literally of Abrahamâs lineage or by adoption. See Gal. 3:26â29; 4:1â7; D&C 84:34; 103:17; 132:30; Abr. 2:9â11. Literal seed may also lose their blessings by disobedience, as in Rom. 9:6â8. See also JSTÂ Matt. 3:36 (Appendix).
