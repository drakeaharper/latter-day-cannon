Frequently referred to in the Old Testament (Ex. 28:39; Judg. 5:30; Ps. 45:14; Ezek. 16:10, 13, 18). The pattern was sometimes woven into the material, sometimes worked by hand with a needle on cloth or linen stretched on a frame. Embroidery was used for hangings in the tabernacle, on the priestsâ clothing, and also in everyday dress.
