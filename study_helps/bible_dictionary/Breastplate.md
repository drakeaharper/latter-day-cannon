(1) The front part of a soldierâs dress, worn for protection. In this sense Isaiah and Paul spoke of a âbreastplate of righteousness,â which all saints should possess, protecting the vital organs against the evil things of life (Isa. 59:17; Eph. 6:14).

(2) The high priest in the law of Moses wore a breastplate as part of his sacred attire. This was called the âbreastplate of judgmentâ (Ex. 28:13â30; 39:8â21). It was made of linen, very colorfully arranged, bearing 12 precious stones and the Urim and Thummim. Other references to a breastplate are found in 1Â Thes. 5:8; Rev. 9:9; D&C 17:1; JSâH 1:35, 42, 52.
