The word scripture means âa writingâ and is used to denote a writing recognized by the Church as sacred and inspired. It is so applied to the books of the Old Testament by the writers of the New Testament (Matt. 22:29; John 5:39; 2Â Tim. 3:15). For an account of the process by which the books of the Old Testament and New Testament came to be recognized as scripture, see Canon. Latter-day revelation identifies scripture as that which is spoken under the influence of the Holy Ghost (D&C 68:1â4).
