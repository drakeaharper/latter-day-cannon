## A Prophetâs Invitation

Last April, soon after the joyful news that the Church had acquired the Kirtland Temple, President RussellÂ M. Nelson invited us to study the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, recorded in section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The dedicatory prayer, said President Nelson, âis a tutorial about how the temple spiritually empowers you and me to meet the challenges of life in these last days.â

I am sure your study of section 109 yielded insights that blessed you. This evening, I share a couple of things I learned as I followed our prophetâs invitation. The peace-giving path down which my study led reminded me that the Lord is merciful and that our Heavenly Fatherâs plan of salvation is truly a plan of mercy.


## Newly Called Missionaries Serving in the Temple

As you may be aware, ânewly called missionaries are encouraged to receive the temple endowment as soon as possible and to attend the temple as often as circumstances allow.â Once endowed, they also âmay serve as temple â¦ workers before they begin missionary service.â

Time in the temple before entering the missionary training center (MTC) can be a wonderful blessing for new missionaries as they learn more about temple covenants before sharing the blessings of those covenants with the world.

But in studying section 109, I learned that in the temple, God empowers new missionariesâindeed, all of usâin an additional, sacred way. In the dedicatory prayer, given by revelation, the Prophet Joseph Smith prayed that âwhen thy servants shall go out from thy house â¦ to bear testimony of thy name,â the âheartsâ of âall peopleâ would âbe softenedââboth the âgreat ones of the earthâ and âall the poor, the needy, and [the] afflicted.â He prayed that âtheir prejudices may give way before the truth, and thy people may obtain favor in the sight of all; that all the ends of the earth may know that we, thy servants, have heard thy voice, and that thou hast sent us.â

This is a beautiful promise for a newly called missionaryâto have prejudices âgive way before the truth,â to âobtain favor in the sight of all,â and to have the world know they are sent by the Lord. Each of us surely needs these same blessings. What a blessing it would be to have hearts softened as we interact with neighbors and coworkers. The dedicatory prayer does not explain exactly how our time in the temple will soften othersâ hearts, but I am convinced it is bound up with how time in the house of the Lord softens our own hearts by centering us on Jesus Christ and His mercy.


## The Lord Answers Joseph Smithâs Plea for Mercy

As I studied the Kirtland dedicatory prayer, I was also struck that Joseph again and again pleaded for mercyâfor the members of the Church, for the enemies of the Church, for the leaders of the country, for the nations of the earth. And, very personally, he pleaded with the Lord to remember him and to have mercy upon his beloved Emma and their children.

How must Joseph have felt when, one week later, on Easter Day, AprilÂ 3, 1836, in the Kirtland Temple, the Savior appeared to him and Oliver Cowdery and, as recorded in section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, said, âI have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house.â This promise of mercy must have had special meaning to Joseph. And as President Nelson taught last April, this promise also âapplies to every dedicated temple today.â


## Finding Mercy in the House of the Lord

There are so many ways in which we each can find mercy in the house of the Lord. This has been true since the Lord first commanded Israel to build a tabernacle and to place at its center the âmercy seat.â In the temple, we find mercy in the covenants we make. Those covenants, in addition to the baptismal covenant, bind us to the Father and the Son and give us increased access to what President Nelson has taught is âa special kind of love and mercy â¦ called hesedâ in Hebrew.

We find mercy in the opportunity to be sealed to our families for eternity. In the temple, we also come to understand with greater clarity that the Creation, the Fall, the Saviorâs atoning sacrifice, and our ability to enter again into our Heavenly Fatherâs presenceâindeed, every part of the plan of salvationâare manifestations of mercy. It might be said that the plan of salvation is a plan of happiness precisely because it is a âplan of mercy.â


## Seeking Forgiveness Opens the Door to the Holy Ghost

I am grateful for the beautiful promise in section 110 that the Lord will manifest Himself in mercy in His temples. I am also grateful for what it reveals about how the Lord will manifest Himself in mercy whenever we, like Joseph, plead for mercy.

Joseph Smithâs plea for mercy in section 109 was not the first time his pleas for mercy prompted revelation. In the Sacred Grove, young Joseph prayed not just to know which Church was true, but he also said that he âcried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go [to] obtain mercy.â Somehow his recognition that he needed mercy that only the Lord could provide helped open the windows of heaven. Three years later the angel Moroni appeared, following what Joseph said was his âprayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies.â

This pattern of revelation following a plea for mercy is a familiar one in the scriptures. Enos heard the voice of the Lord only after praying for forgiveness. King Lamoniâs fatherâs conversion begins with his prayer, âI will give away all my sins to know thee.â We may not be blessed with these same dramatic experiences, but for those who sometimes struggle to feel answers to prayer, seeking the Lordâs mercy is one of the most powerful ways to feel the witness of the Holy Ghost.


## Pondering Godâs Mercy Opens the Door to a Testimony of the Book of Mormon

A similar principle is beautifully taught in Moroni 10:3â5. We often shorthand these verses to teach that through sincere prayer, we can learn whether the Book of Mormon is true. But this shorthand can neglect the important role of mercy. Listen to how Moroni begins his exhortation: âI would exhort you that when ye shall read these things,Â â¦ that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.â

Moroni urges us not only to read these thingsâthe records he was about to seal upâbut also to ponder in our hearts what the Book of Mormon reveals about âhow merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men.â It is pondering upon the Lordâs mercy that prepares us to âask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true.â

As we ponder on the Book of Mormon, we might ask: Is it really true, as Alma taught, that Godâs plan of mercy assures that every person who ever lived on this earth will be resurrected and that they will âbe restored to their â¦ perfect frameâ? Is Amulek rightâcan the Saviorâs mercy satisfy all the bitterly real demands of justice that we would otherwise be obligated to pay and instead â[encircle us] in the arms of safetyâ?

Is it true, as Alma testified, that Christ suffered not only for our sins but for our âpains and afflictionsâ so that He could âknow â¦ how to succor his people according to their infirmitiesâ? Is the Lord really so merciful, as King Benjamin taught, that as a free gift, He atoned âfor the sins of those â¦ who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinnedâ?

Is it true, as Lehi said, that âAdam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joyâ? And is it really true, as Abinadi testified, quoting Isaiah, that Jesus Christ was âwounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healedâ?

In sum, is the Fatherâs plan as taught in the Book of Mormon really this merciful? I testify that it is and that the peace-giving and hopeful teachings of mercy in the Book of Mormon are true.

Still, I imagine that some may be struggling, despite your faithful reading and prayers, to realize Moroniâs promise that Heavenly Father âwill manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.â I know this struggle because I felt it, many years ago, when my own first couple of reads of the Book of Mormon did not yield an immediate and clear answer to my prayers.

If you are struggling, may I invite you to follow Moroniâs counsel to ponder on the many ways the Book of Mormon teaches âhow merciful the Lord hath been [to] the children of menâ? Based on my experience, I hope that when you do, the peace of the Holy Ghost can enter your heart and you can know, believe, and feel that the Book of Mormon and the plan of mercy it teaches are true.

I express my gratitude for the Fatherâs great plan of mercy and for the Saviorâs willingness to carry it out. I know that He will manifest Himself in mercy in His holy temple and in every part of our life if we will seek Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
