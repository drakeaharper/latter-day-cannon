President RussellÂ M. Nelson taught that if the Lord were speaking to us directly, the first thing He would make sure we understand is our true identity: we are children of God, children of the covenant, and disciples of Jesus Christ. Any other designation will ultimately let us down.

I learned this for myself when my oldest son received his first cell phone. With great excitement, he began entering the names of his family and friends into his contacts. One day I noticed his mom was calling. On the screen appeared the name âMother.â That was a sensible and dignified choiceâand, Iâll admit, a sign of respect for the better parent in our home. Naturally, I got curious. What name had he given me?

I scrolled through his contacts, assuming that if Wendi was âMother,â I must be âFather.â Not there. I searched for âDad.â Still nothing. My curiosity turned into mild concern. âDoes he call me âCoreyâ?â No. In a last-ditch effort, I thought, âWeâre soccer playersâmaybe he calls me âPelÃ©.ââ Wishful thinking. Finally, I called his number myself, and two words popped up on his screen: âNot Motherâ!

Brothers and sisters, by which name are you called?

Jesus called His followers by many names: Disciples. Sons and daughters. Children of the prophets. Sheep. Friends. The light of the world. Saints. Each carries eternal significance and underscores a personal relationship with the Savior.

But among these names, one rises above the restâthe name of Christ. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin powerfully taught:

âThere is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ.Â â¦

âAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.â

Those who take upon themselves the name of Christ become His disciples and witnesses. In the book of Acts, we read that after the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, chosen witnesses were commanded to testify that whosoever believed in Jesus, was baptized, and received the Holy Ghost would receive a remission of sins. Those who received these sacred ordinances assembled with the Church, became disciples, and were called Christians. The Book of Mormon also describes believers in Christ as Christians and covenant people as âthe children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters.â

What does it mean to be called by the name of Christ? It means making and keeping covenants, always remembering Him, keeping His commandments, and being âwilling â¦ to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things.â It means standing with prophets and apostles as they carry Christâs messageâwith its doctrine, covenants, and ordinancesâacross the world. It also means serving others to relieve suffering, being a light, and bringing hope in Christ to all people. Of course, this is a lifelong pursuit. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that âthis is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.â

Because the journey of discipleship takes time and effort built âline upon line, precept upon precept,â itâs easy to get caught up in worldly titles. These yield only temporary value and will never be enough on their own. Redemption and the things of eternity only âcometh in and through the Holy Messiah.â Therefore, following prophetic counsel to make discipleship a priority is both timely and wise, especially in an age of so many competing voices and influences. This was at the heart of King Benjaminâs counsel when he said, âI would that ye should remember to retain the name [of Christ] written always in your hearts, â¦ that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.â

Iâve seen this in my own family. My great-grandfather Martin Gassner was changed forever because a humble branch president answered the Saviorâs call. In Germany in 1909, times were tough and money was tight. Martin worked as a welder in a pipe manufacturing plant. By his own admission, most paydays ended in drinking, smoking, and buying rounds at the pub. His wife finally warned him that if he didnât change, she would leave.

One day, Martinâs coworker met him on the way to the pub with a crumpled religious booklet in his hand. He had found it on the street and told Martin that he felt something different after reading the pamphlet entitled Was wissen Sie von den Mormonen?, or What Do You Know About the Mormons? Iâm certain that title has changed.

An address stamped on the back was just legible enough to decipher where the church was located. It was a considerable distance away, but they were moved by what they read and decided to take the train that Sunday to investigate. When they arrived, they found that the address was not the church they expected but a funeral home. Martin hesitatedâbecause, really, a church in a funeral home sounded a little too much like a package deal.

But upstairs, in a rented hall, they found a small group of Saints. A man invited them to testimony meeting. Martin was touched by the Spirit and was so impressed by the simple, fervent testimonies that he bore his testimony. And it was there, in that most unlikely place, that he said he already knew it must be true.

Afterward the man introduced himself as the branch president and asked if they would return. Martin explained that he lived too far away and couldnât afford the weekly trip. The branch president simply said, âFollow me.â

They walked a few blocks to a nearby factory where the branch presidentâs friend worked. After a short conversation, Martin and his friend were both offered jobs. Then the branch president led them to an apartment building and secured housing for their families.

All of this happened within two hours. Martinâs family moved the following week. Six months later they were baptized. The man once known as a hopeless drunk became so ardent in his new faith that people in town began calling him, perhaps not so affectionately, âthe priest.â

As for the branch president, I cannot tell you his nameâhis identity has been lost to time. But I call him a disciple, ambassador, Christian, good Samaritan, and friend. His influence is still felt 116 years later, and I stand on the shoulders of his discipleship.

âThere is a saying that you can count the seeds in an apple, but you canât count the apples that come from one seed.â The seed planted by the branch president has produced countless fruit. Little would he have known that 48 years later, several generations of Martinâs family on both sides of the veil would be sealed in the Bern Switzerland Temple.

Perhaps the greatest sermons are the ones we never hear but those we see in the quiet, unassuming actions and deeds observed in the lives of ordinary people who, trying to be like Jesus, go about doing good. What this gracious branch president did was not part of a checklist. He was simply living the gospel as described in the book of Alma: âThey did not send away any â¦ that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, â¦ they were liberal to all, both old and young, â¦ both male and female.â And, a point we should not overlook, they did not send away any âwhether out of the church or in the church.â

Those who take upon themselves the name of Christ recognize, as Joseph Smith said, âA man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.â

This is how Jesus lived. In fact, He did so much that His disciples couldnât write it all down. The Apostle John recorded, âThere are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.â

Let us strive to follow Christâs example, doing good and making discipleship a lifelong priority so that each time we interact with others, they will feel Godâs love and the confirming power of the Holy Ghost. Then we may join my great-grandfather and millions of others who have declared, like the disciple Andrew, âWe have found the Messias.â

In the end, our identity isnât defined by the world. But our discipleship is defined by the ordinances we receive, the covenants we keep, and the love we show to God and neighbor by simply doing good. As President Nelson taught, we are indeed children of God, children of the covenant, disciples of Jesus Christ.

I testify that Jesus Christ lives and has redeemed us. He is the One who said, âI have called thee by â¦ name; thou art mine.â In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
