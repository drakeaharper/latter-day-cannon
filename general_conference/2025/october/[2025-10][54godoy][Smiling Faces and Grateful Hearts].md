A little over a year ago, I was released from my assignment in the Presidency of the Seventy, a change announced here at general conference. Because my name was read near those of General Authorities becoming emeritus, many assumed I was also finishing my time of service. After the conference, I received numerous messages of gratitude and good wishes for my next phase in life. Some even offered to buy my house in North Salt Lake. It was nice to see that I would be missed and also to know we will not have trouble selling our home when I am done. But I am not there yet.

My new assignment took Monica and me to beautiful Africa, where the Church is flourishing. It has been a blessing to serve among the faithful Saints in the Africa South Area and witness the Lordâs love for them. Itâs inspiring to see generational families of all backgrounds, including many successful and well-educated Church members, dedicating their time and talents to serve others.

At the same time, given the regionâs demographics, many people of modest means are joining the Church and transforming their lives through the blessings of tithing faithfulness and the educational opportunities offered by the Church. Programs such as Succeed in School, EnglishConnect, BYUâPathway Worldwide, and the Perpetual Education Fund bless many lives, especially those of the rising generation.

President JamesÂ E. Faust once stated, âIt has been said that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great.â

The greatness of our Saints in Africa becomes even more evident as they face lifeâs challenges and the demands of a growing Church. They always approach it with a positive attitude. They embody well the well-known teaching from President RussellÂ M. Nelson:

âThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.

âWhen the focus of our lives is on Godâs plan of salvation â¦ and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happeningâor not happeningâin our lives.â

They find joy despite their challenges. They have learned that our relationship with the Savior enables us to approach difficulties with smiling faces and grateful hearts.

Let me share some of my experiences with these faithful Saints who illustrate this principle, starting with Mozambique.


## Mozambique

A few months ago, I presided over a stake conference for a one-year-old stake that already had 10 units. More than 2,000 people filled the small chapel and three tents that were set outside. The stake president is 31 years old, his wife is 26, and they have two small children. He leads this growing and challenging stake with no complaintsâonly a smiling face and a grateful heart.

In an interview with the patriarch, I learned that his wife was seriously ill, and he struggled to provide for her care. After addressing the issue with the stake president, we gave her a priesthood blessing. I inquired of the patriarch how many patriarchal blessings he gives on average.

âEight to ten,â he said.

I asked, âPer month?â

He replied, âPer week!â I counseled him that doing that many per weekend was not wise.

âElder Godoy,â he said, âthey keep coming every week, including new members and many youths.â Again, no complaintsâonly a smiling face and a grateful heart.

After the Saturday evening session of stake conference, on my way to the hotel, I noticed people buying food along the road late at night. I asked my driver why they were doing it when it was so dark rather than during the day. He responded that they were working during the day to have the money to do it later.

âOh, they were working today to eat tomorrow,â I said.

But he corrected me: âNo, they were working during the day to eat tonight.â I had hoped our members might be in a better situation, but he confirmed that many faced similar challenges in that part of the country. The next morning, during our Sunday session and newly aware of their circumstances, I was even more moved by their smiling faces and grateful hearts.


## Zambia

On the way to a Sunday meeting, the stake president and I saw a couple walking along the road with a baby and two small children. We stopped to offer them a ride. They were surprised and delighted. When I asked how far they needed to walk to the chapel, the father replied that it could take 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the childrenâs pace. They faced this journey back and forth, every Sunday, with no complaintsâonly smiling faces and grateful hearts.


## Malawi

One Sunday before a stake conference, I visited two branches using public schools as meetinghouses. I was shocked by the humble and modest conditions of the buildings, which lacked even some basic amenities. As I met a few members there, I was ready to apologize for the inadequate conditions of their meetinghouse, but they were happy to have a nearby place to gather, avoiding the usual long walk. Again, there were no complaintsâonly smiling faces and grateful hearts.


## Zimbabwe

Following a Saturday of leadership training, the stake president took me to Sunday services held in a rented house. There were 240 people in attendance. Then the bishop introduced 10 new members baptized that week. The congregation was spread across two small rooms, with some members also sitting outside the building, watching the meeting through windows and doors. There were no complaintsâonly smiling faces and grateful hearts.


## Lesotho

I visited this beautiful small country, also known as âthe mountain kingdom,â to see a Church district preparing to become a stake. Following a Saturday of meetings, I attended Sunday services in one of their branches in a rented house. The sacramental room was overflowing, with people standing outside the door to participate. I told the branch president that he needed a bigger house. To my surprise, he informed me that this was only half of his membership. The other half would attend a second sacrament meeting after the second hour. Again, there were no complaintsâonly smiling faces and grateful hearts.

I returned to Lesotho later due to a fatal traffic accident involving several of our youth, already mentioned by Elder D.Â Todd Christofferson earlier. When I visited the families and leaders, I expected a somber atmosphere. Instead, I encountered strong and resilient Saints who were coping with the situation in an uplifting and inspiring way.

Mpho Aniciah Nku, 14, a surviving accident victim in this picture, illustrated it well in her own words: âTrust in Jesus and always look unto Him, because through Him youâll find peace, and He will help you in the healing process.â

These are just a few examples where we see their positive attitude because they center their lives in the gospel of Jesus Christ. They know where to find help and hope.


## The Saviorâs Healing Power

Why can the Savior succor them and us in any circumstances of our lives? The answer can be found in the scriptures:

âAnd he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind.Â â¦

ââ¦Â And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, â¦ that he may know â¦ how to succor his people according to their infirmities.â

As Elder DavidÂ A. Bednar taught, there is no physical pain, anguish, or weakness we can experience that the Savior does not know. âYou and I in a moment of weakness may cry out, âNo one understands [what I am going through].Â â¦â No human being, perhaps, knows. But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands.â And why? Because âHe felt and bore our burdens before we ever did.â

I conclude with my testimony of Christâs words found in Matthew 11:

âCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

âTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

âFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.â

Just like those Saints in Africa, I know this promise is true. It is true there, and itâs true everywhere. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
