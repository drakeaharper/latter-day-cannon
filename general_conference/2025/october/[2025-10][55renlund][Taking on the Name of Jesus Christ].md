In 2018, at the University of Utah, a special professorship was created called the âDr.Â RussellÂ M. Nelson and DantzelÂ W. Nelson Presidential Chair in Cardiothoracic Surgeryââcardio, meaning âheart,â and thoracic, meaning âchest.â It honored President Nelsonâs important work as a heart surgeon and the support he received from his late wife, Dantzel. This professorship was paid for by a fund designed to last into the future. The individual selected for this type of prestigious professorship receives recognition, salary support, and research funds.

The first surgeon chosen to hold the professorship was Dr.Â CraigÂ H. Selzman, a skilled heart surgeon who is not a member of our church. At the ceremony to award this professorship to Dr.Â Selzman, many important guests were in attendance, including President Nelson and his wife Sister WendyÂ W. Nelson. During the meeting, President Nelson spoke modestly of his pioneering surgical career.

Then Dr.Â Selzman shared what it meant to him to be appointed to this professorship. He related that four days earlier, after a long day in the operating room, he discovered that one of his patients needed to go back to surgery. He was tired and disappointed, knowing he would have to spend another night in the hospital.

This evening, Dr.Â Selzman had a life-changing conversation with himself. In the moment, he thought: âOn Friday, I will be appointed to a professorship named after Dr.Â Nelson. He was always known as someone who kept his emotions in check, treated everyone with respect, and never lost his temper. Now that my name will be linked with his, I need to try to be more like him.â Dr.Â Selzman was already a very considerate surgeon. But he wanted to become even better.

In the past, his surgical team might have been aware of his fatigue and frustration because he may have let it show in his manner and tone of voice. But in the operating room that night, Dr.Â Selzman made a conscientious effort to be especially supportive and understanding of his team. He felt it made a difference and resolved to continue trying to be more like Dr.Â Nelson.

Five years later, President Nelson donated his professional papers to the University of Utah. Dignitaries from the university came to formally thank President Nelson. During this event, Dr.Â Selzman spoke again. Referring to President Nelsonâs initials, RMN, he said, âThere is an âRMNâ ethos that now pervades the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Utah.â

In frustrating situations, Dr.Â Selzman explained: âI do what we now teach our trainees to doâfocus, get over it, and do the best you can. This ethos lives in us every day. We give lapel pins to every member of the division and each new trainee. At the bottom of the pin are the letters âRMN.â The RMN ethos is foundational to our training; we teach it to everyone.â Dr.Â Selzman had intentionally improved his prior attitude and aspirations because his name was now linked to that of President Nelson.

This series of events involving Dr.Â Selzman caused me to ask myself: âHow have I changed since I linked my name with the name of Jesus Christ? Have I adopted a Christlike ethos as a result? Have I genuinely tried to become better and more like Him?â

In Dr.Â Selzmanâs experience, we can see at least five parallels to the process through which we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Even though that process begins with baptism, it is not complete until we are more pure and holy and have become more like Him.

The first parallel is identification. Dr.Â Selzmanâs appointment to the Nelson professorship linked his name to President Nelsonâs, and Dr.Â Selzman began to identify with President Nelson. When we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, we link our name with His. We identify with Him. We gladly become known as Christian. We acknowledge the Savior and unapologetically stand up to be counted as His.

Closely related to identification is another parallelâremembrance. When Dr.Â Selzman goes into his office, his eyes are drawn to the medallion he received when he was appointed to the Nelson professorship. This medallion reminds him daily of the RMN ethos. For us, partaking of the sacrament each week helps us remember Jesus Christ throughout the week. As we partake of the sacrament, we do so in remembrance of the price He paid to redeem us. We covenant anew to remember Him, recognize His greatness, and appreciate His goodness. We acknowledge repeatedly that it is only in and through His grace that we are saved from physical and spiritual death.

Remembrance means that we follow the advice given by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. We âlet all [our] doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever [we go, we] let it be in the Lord; â¦ [we] let all [our] thoughts be directed unto the Lord; â¦ [and we] let the affections of [our hearts] be placed upon the Lord forever.â Even when we are occupied with other matters, we remain mindful of Him, just as we remember our own names, regardless of what else we focus on.

An outgrowth of remembering what the Savior has done for us is a third parallelâemulation. Dr.Â Selzman began to emulate President Nelson and the RMN ethos. I believe that President Nelsonâs ethos is simply a manifestation of his lifelong discipleship of Jesus Christ. For us, the more we identify with and remember Jesus Christ, the more we want to be like Him. As His disciples, we change for the better when we focus on Him, more so than when we focus on ourselves. We strive to become like Him and seek to be blessed with His attributes. We pray fervently to be filled with charity, the pure love of Christ.

As President Nelson taught in April: âAs charity becomes part of our nature, we will lose the impulse to demean others. We will stop judging others. We will have charity for those from all walks of life. Charity towards all â¦ is essential to our progress. Charity is the foundation of a godly character.â Alongside charity, we seek, âcultivate, â¦ and expandâ other spiritual gifts from the Savior, including integrity, patience, and diligence.

Emulating Jesus Christ leads us to a fourth parallelâalignment with His purposes. We join Him in His work. As a surgeon, Dr.Â Nelson was known as a teacher, a healer, and a researcher. The lapel pin used in Dr.Â Selzmanâs division emphasizes these endeavors, featuring the words teach, heal, and discover. For us, part of taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ involves willingly, intentionally, and enthusiastically aligning our goals with His. We join Him in His work when we âlove, share, and invite.â We join Him in His work when we minister to others, especially the vulnerable and those who have been wounded, shattered, or crushed by their earthly experiences.

So we more fully take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through identification, remembrance, emulation, and alignment. Doing these four leads us to a fifth parallelâempowerment. We access Godâs power and blessings in our lives. The Nelson professorship provides Dr.Â Selzman recognition and support funds that he is using to change the culture in his division. He applies this âendowment of powerâ to help others. In a similar way, when we take upon ourselves the name of the Savior, our Heavenly Father blesses us with His power to help us fulfill our mission in mortality.

As we make additional covenants with God, we take upon ourselves more fully the name of Jesus Christ. Consequently, God blesses us with more of His power. As President Nelson taught: âEach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in templesâand keeps themâhas increased access to the power of Jesus Christ. â¦ The reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power â¦ that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.â

We become more spiritually receptive. We have more courage to confront seemingly impossible circumstances. We are strengthened more in our resolve to follow Jesus Christ. We more speedily repent and return to Him when we transgress. We become better at sharing His gospel with His power and authority. We help those in need while being less judgmental, far less judgmental. We retain a remission of our sins. We have greater peace, and we are more cheerful because we can always rejoice. His glory will be round about us, and His angels will have charge over us.

The Savior invites us, âCome unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.â I urge you to do this. Come unto our Heavenly Father. Take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ. Identify with Him. Always remember Him. Strive to be like Him. Join Him in His work. Receive His power and blessings in your life. Etch His name in your heart, willingly and intentionally. This gives you âstandingâ before God and qualifies you for the Saviorâs advocacy on your behalf. You will become an exalted inheritor in the kingdom of our Father in Heaven, a joint-heir with His Firstborn, our beloved Savior and Redeemer.

He lives. I absolutely know it. He loves you. He gave His life for you. He pleads with you to come unto the Father through Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
