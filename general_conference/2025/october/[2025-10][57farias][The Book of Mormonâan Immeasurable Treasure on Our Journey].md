Can you remember a moment when someone gave you a gift that changed your life? This October marks 40 years since I received one of the greatest gifts in my life. While I was in high school, I noticed that one of our classmates had a light that was different from most of the other young people. I enjoyed being around him. One day he told me he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then he offered me a gift: a copy of the Book of Mormon. He invited me to read a few pages and meet with two friends who could answer my questions. Those friends were the missionaries.

When I met with the missionaries, they taught me the doctrine of Christ and invited me to follow the prophet Moroniâs invitation: âWhen ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghostâ (Moroni 10:4).

I read several pages of the Book of Mormon and prayed. Although I did not yet have a deep understanding of all the things that the missionaries were teaching me, I felt in my heart that what I was reading was good and came from God. I received the confirmation of Moroniâs promise: âAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all thingsâ (Moroni 10:5).

After I was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some friends tried to convince me that I had made the wrong decision. But each time I faced such doubts or opposition, I received renewed confirmation through studying the scriptures and praying to stay true to the covenants I had entered into with God. Since then, the Book of Mormon has been my companion and has become an immeasurable treasure in my mortal journey.

The Book of Mormon is more than just a book. It is another testament of Jesus Christ, written by many ancient prophets through the spirit of prophecy and revelation.

The most significant event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites shortly after His Resurrection. The Book of Mormon âputs forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to comeâ (introduction to the Book of Mormon).

The first edition of the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ was published in a small town in the state of New York in March 1830. The Prophet Joseph Smith was only 23 years old when he completed the translation of the book in 1829. He translated almost the entire book in less than 75 days, and the printing process took about seven months.

Today, approximately 80,000 full-time missionaries in more than 150 countries are serving as volunteers, dedicating their lives to bearing witness that the Book of Mormon is true and that it testifies of Jesus Christ.

At the most recent seminar for new mission leaders in June of this year, President RussellÂ M. Nelson shared his powerful testimony of the Book of Mormon: âThe Book of Mormon isÂ â¦ the word of God. It teaches the doctrine of Christ and explains more about the Saviorâs Atonement than does any other book.â

I would like to offer three suggestions that can help deepen our conversion to Jesus Christ through a study of the Book of Mormon:


## 1. Be Diligent and Consistent in Your Daily Study

Like Alma and the sons of Mosiah, we must â[search] the scriptures diligently, that [we] might know the word of Godâ and be strengthened in the truth (Alma 17:2).

While serving as mission leaders in the Georgia Atlanta Mission, my wife and I encouraged every missionary to study the Book of Mormon for at least 30 minutes daily. That commitment increased our faith and helped us to seek and expect miracles.

Itâs possible that after the mission we may not have the same amount of time available for daily scripture study, but I promise that if you sincerely prioritize studying the Book of Mormon prayerfully each day, you will find greater spiritual strength and confidence in the Lord and His promises.


## 2. Make Your Study More Meaningful by Feasting upon the Words of Christ

Nephi taught, âFeast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should doâ (2Â Nephi 32:3).

To feast means more than just readingâit means savoring, pondering, and applying. As you study the Book of Mormon, consider ways to make your scripture study more meaningful. For example:

Use study aids available in the Gospel Library app.

Identify eternal truths that help us understand Godâs plan and lead us to make and keep covenants with our Heavenly Father.

Highlight significant phrases and record your impressions to preserve what you have learned during your study.

The Book of Mormon has the power to answer questions of our souls. As Nephi said, we should âliken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learningâ (1Â Nephi 19:23).

As we feast upon the words of Christ, they will open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do in the various circumstances of our life to draw closer to Him.


## 3. Bear Your Testimony of the Truthfulness of the Book of Mormon

Just as Lehi desired to share the fruit of the tree of life with his family (see 1Â Nephi 8:12), when we gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon, we develop a desire to share the joy that comes from knowing the gospel of Jesus Christ.

One of our missionaries, Sister Benson, who is attending with us this session, shared with me her desire to help her young brother. At that time, he was preparing to attend college and wasnât sure about serving a mission. I felt impressed to invite Sister Benson to read the Book of Mormon during the first four months of her mission, marking her favorite verses, and then to send that copy to her brother.

Sister Benson sent the marked copy of the Book of Mormon and invited her brother to read from it each night. She later shared with me: âBefore my mission, my brother wasnât sure if he wanted to serve a full-time mission. Slowly, over time, as he read the Book of Mormon, he found increasing joy in his life and began to consider serving a mission.â

Two weeks before Sister Benson completed her mission, her brother received his mission call. He is now serving in the Mexico Tuxtla GutiÃ©rrez Mission. Through the Book of Mormon, Elder Benson came to see his life with spiritual clarity, which led him to serve the Lord and trust that things would work out. That decision was a miracleâinfluenced by the power of the words of Christ.

My beloved brothers and sisters, I encourage each of you to deepen your study of the Book of Mormon. I know as we feast upon the words of Christ found in the Book of Mormon, the Spirit will help us understand eternal truths and share our testimonies with conviction with those whom the Lord has prepared to hear His message. The Lord said, âMine elect hear my voice and harden not their heartsâ (Doctrine and Covenants 29:7). I testify that those who ask God in faith will gain a testimony of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon by the power of the Holy Ghost. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
