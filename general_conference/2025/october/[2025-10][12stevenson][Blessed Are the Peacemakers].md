Welcome to general conference. How grateful we are to be gathered.

As we anticipate these conference proceedings, we are acutely aware of the weeks leading up to it. We realize that our hearts are mourning loss, and some feel uncertainty caused by violence or tragedy throughout the world. Even devout people gathered in sacred spacesâincluding our hallowed chapel in Michiganâhave lost their lives or loved ones. I speak from my heart, realizing that many of your hearts are burdened by what you, your families, and our world have undergone since last general conference.


## Capernaum in Galilee

Imagine with me you are a young teenager in Capernaum, near the Sea of Galilee, during the ministry of Jesus Christ. Word spreads of a rabbiâa teacherâwhose message draws multitudes. Neighbors plan to travel to a mount overlooking the sea to hear Him.

You join others walking the dusty roads of Galilee. Upon your arrival, the large crowd gathered to hear this Jesus surprises you. Some quietly whisper, âMessiah.â

You listen. His words touch your heart. On the long walk home, you choose quiet over conversation.

You ponder wondrous thingsâthings that transcend even the law of Moses. He spoke of turning the other cheek and loving your enemies. He promised, âBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.â

In your reality, as you feel the weight of difficult daysâuncertainty and fearâpeace feels distant.

Your pace quickens; you arrive home breathless. Your family gathers; your father asks, âTell us what you heard and feel.â

You share that He invited you to let your light shine before others, to seek righteousness even when persecuted. Your voice catches as you repeat, âBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.â

You ask, âCan I truly become a peacemaker when the world is in commotion, when my heart is filled with fear, and when peace seems so far away?â

Your father glances at your mother and answers gently, âYes. We begin in the most basic placeâin our hearts. Then in our homes and families. As we practice there, peacemaking can spread to our streets and villages.â


## Fast Forward 2,000 Years

Fast forward 2,000 years. No need to imagineâthis is our reality. Although the pressures felt by todayâs rising generation differ from those of the young person in Galileeâpolarization, secularization, retaliation, road rage, outrage, and social media pile-onsâboth generations face cultures of conflict and tension.

Gratefully, our young men and women are similarly drawn to their Sermon-on-the-Mount moments: seminary, For the Strength of Youth conferences, and Come, Follow Me. Here they receive the same enduring invitations from the Lord: to let their light shine before others, to seek righteousness even when persecuted, and to love their enemies.

They also receive encouraging words from living prophets of the Restoration: âPeacemakers needed.â Disagree without being disagreeable. Replace contention and pride with forgiveness and love. Build bridges of cooperation and understanding, not walls of prejudice or segregation. And the same promise: âBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.â

The hearts of todayâs rising generation are filled with a testimony of Jesus Christ and a hope for the future. Yet they too ask, âCan I truly become a peacemaker when the world is in commotion, my heart is filled with fear, and peace seems so far away?â

The resounding response is once again yes! We embrace the words of the Savior: âPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. â¦ Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.â

Today, peacemaking still begins in the most basic placeâin our hearts. Then in homes and families. As we practice there, peacemaking will spread into our neighborhoods and communities.

Letâs further consider these three places where a modern-day Latter-day Saint makes peace.


## Peacemaking in Our Hearts

The first is in our hearts. A visible element of Christâs ministry demonstrates how children were drawn to Him. Therein lies a clue. Looking into the pure and innocent peacemaking heart of a child can be an inspiration for our hearts. Here is how several Primary-age children answered âWhat does it look like to be a peacemaker?â

I share their responses straight from their hearts! Luke said, âAlways help others.â Grace shared how important it is to forgive each other, even when it doesnât feel fair. Anna said, âI saw someone who didnât have anyone to play with, so I went to play with her.â Lindy reflected that to be a peacemaker is to help others. âThen you pass it on. It will just keep going on and on.â Liam said, âDonât be mean to people, even if they are mean to you.â London exclaimed, âIf someone teases or is mean to you, you say, âPlease stop.ââ Trevor observed, âIf there is one donut left and you all want it, you share.â

These childrenâs responses are evidence to me that we are all born with divine inclinations toward kindness and compassion. The gospel of Jesus Christ nurtures and knits these divine traits, including peacemaking, into our hearts, blessing us in this life and the next.


## Peacemaking at Home

Second, building peacemaking in our homes by using the Lordâs pattern to influence our relationships with one another: persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, kindness, meekness, and love unfeigned.

Here is an inspiring story that demonstrates how one family made peacemaking a family affair, putting these principles into practice.

Children in this family were struggling in their relationship with an adult whose demeanor was often grumpy, condescending, and curt. The children, hurt and frustrated, began to wonder if the only way forward was to mirror that same mean-spirited behavior.

One evening the family spoke openly together about the tension and the toll it was taking. And then an idea emergedânot just a solution but an experiment.

Instead of responding with silence or retaliation, the children would do something unexpected: they would respond with kindness. Not just polite restraint but a deliberate, heartfelt outpouring of kind words and thoughtful deeds, no matter how they were treated in return. All agreed to try it for a set time, after which theyâd regroup and reflect.

Though some were hesitant at first, they committed to the plan with genuine hearts.

What happened next was nothing short of remarkable.

The cold exchanges began to thaw. Smiles replaced scowls. The adult, once distant and harsh, began to change. The children, empowered by their choice to lead with love, found joy in the transformation. The change was so profound that the planned follow-up meeting was never needed. Kindness had done its quiet work.

In time, true bonds of friendship were formed, lifting everyone. To be peacemakers, we forgive others and deliberately build others up instead of tearing them down.


## Peacemaking in Our Communities

Third, peacemaking in our communities. In the troubled years of World WarÂ II, Elder JohnÂ A. Widtsoe taught: âThe only way to build a peaceful community is to build men and women who are lovers and makers of peace. Each individual, by that doctrine of Christ â¦ holds in his hands the peace of the [whole] world.â

The following story beautifully illustrates that precept.

Several years ago, two menâa Muslim imam and a Christian pastor from Nigeriaâstood on opposite sides of a painful religious divide. Each had suffered deeply. And yet, through the healing power of forgiveness, they chose to walk a path together.

Imam Muhammad Ashafa and Pastor James Wuye became friends and unlikely partners in peace. Together they established a center for interfaith mediation. They now teach others to replace hatred with hope. As two-time nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize, they recently became inaugural recipients of the Commonwealth Peace Prize.

These former enemies now travel side by side rebuilding what was broken, living witnesses that the Saviorâs invitation to be peacemakers is not only possibleâit is powerful.

When we come to know the glory of God, then we âwill not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably.â In our congregations and our communities, may we choose to see one another as children of God.


## A One-Week Peacemaker Plan

In summary, I offer an invitation. Peacemaking demands actionâwhat might that be, for each of us, starting tomorrow? Would you consider a one-week, three-step peacemaker plan?

A contention-free home zone: When contention starts, pause and reboot with kind words and deeds.

Digital bridge building: Before posting, replying, or commenting online, ask, Will this build a bridge? If not, stop. Do not send. Instead, share goodness. Publish peace in the place of hate.

Repair and reunite: Each family member could seek out a strained relationship in order to apologize, minister, repair, and reunite.


## Conclusion

It has been a few months since I felt an undeniable impression leading to this message: âBlessed Are the Peacemakers.â In conclusion, may I share impressions that have pressed upon my heart over this time.

Peacemaking is a Christlike attribute. Peacemakers are sometimes labeled naive or weakâfrom all sides. Yet, to be a peacemaker is not to be weak but to be strong in a way that the world may not understand. Peacemaking requires courage and compromise but does not require sacrifice of principle. Peacemaking is to lead with an open heart, not a closed mind. It is to approach one another with extended hands, not clenched fists. Peacemaking is not a new thing, hot off the press. It was taught by Jesus Christ Himself, both to those in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Peacemaking has since been taught by modern-day prophets from the earliest days of the Restoration even to this day.

We fulfill our divine role as children of a loving Heavenly Father as we strive to become peacemakers. I bear testimony of Jesus Christ, who is the Prince of Peace, the Son of the living God, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
