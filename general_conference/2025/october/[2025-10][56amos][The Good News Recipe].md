If you have ever visited my home state of Louisiana, you are probably familiar with many of our tasty dishesâgumbo, jambalaya, Ã©touffÃ©e, and the list goes on and on.

From time to time, I find myself feeling bold enough to cook one of those tasty recipes. The undocumented final step after mixing all the ingredients and following the detailed instructions is to do the final taste test and see if anything is missing. At that point, I can hear the Creole cooking legends whispering in my ears, âPut more Tonyâs in it.â Tonyâs is a Creole seasoning made in Opelousas, Louisiana, my hometown. It is often used as the âsecret ingredientâ to compensate for the imperfections made while following the recipe.

My wife, Michelle, and I had the honor to serve as mission leaders in Louisiana. We had a tradition of teaching the missionaries how to cook her special jambalaya recipe on their last night in the mission home before they returned to their families. In addition to their testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, our missionaries left the mission with an appreciation for recipes.

A few months ago, I was browsing through the Church Media Library and saw a link to a collection of short videos called Restoration Conversations with President RussellÂ M. Nelson. The title of one of the short videos in the list caught my attention and made me smile. It is called âScriptures Are Godâs Recipes for Happy Living.â I immediately clicked on that two-minute video and watched President Nelson teach a group of Primary kids a simple and powerful message about how to be happy. He taught: âIf youâre making a cake, you follow the directions, donât you? And youâll get a good result every time, wonât you?â

He continued, speaking about turning 95 years old soon: âPeople say, âWhat do you eat? Whatâs your secret?ââ He replied, âThe secretâs called the scriptures. You might read them and try them.â

Well, there we have it. The simple secret for happy living is to just follow Godâs recipe as detailed in the scriptures. I call it the âGood News Recipe.â

What do you do if something goes wrong when following the recipe? Well, embedded in the Good News Recipe is the âsecret ingredientâ to ensure you always get it right in the end. The answer is always Jesus Christ.

I think we all have moments when we feel our ingredients are not good enough, or we struggle to follow the directions, or perhaps we do something out of order, or something happens that is out of our control, and so on.

Whatâs the remedy? Itâs simply to add more of what invites Jesus Christ into your life.

So, what might it look like to add more Jesus Christ into your life?

While serving as mission president, I had the pleasure of meeting personally with each of our young missionaries every six weeks. During the one-on-one meeting, it was common for missionaries to seek guidance on how to improve the effectiveness of their companionships.

On one occasion, a missionary came into his personal interview and sat down. I could tell from his body language that something was weighing heavily on his mind. I asked, âElder, what would you like to discuss today?â He went on to describe some of the challenges he was having with his companion and how it was affecting their ability to do missionary work. With tears in his eyes, he looked at me and asked, âPresident, what should I do?â

In that instance, I honestly didnât know how to respond. After a brief moment, I asked him if it was OK for us to kneel together in prayer for guidance from the Spirit. He agreed, and we knelt together and prayed for inspiration.

After the prayer, we continued kneeling for a short time and then sat in our chairs facing each other. I asked if we could read a scripture together. As we opened our scriptures, I paused and told him, âElder, as we read this scripture, please ask yourself the following question: If I live these attributes, will it improve my companionship and our missionary work?â

Then we opened Moroni 7:45 and read out loud: âAnd charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.â

The elder then looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, âYes, President, but that is hard to do.â I agreed and reminded him that he is a son of God with divine potential to do it together with the Lord.

Then we briefly discussed the parable of the slope taught by Elder ClarkÂ G. Gilbert of the Seventy, which reminded us that we need to start where we are and, together with the Lord, move forward and upward in a positive direction. I could tell that he was still feeling a bit overwhelmed with the next steps, so I asked him to describe his understanding of the scripture âby small and simple things are great things brought to pass.â He went on to describe the concept that by doing small and simple things, great things can happen. I asked him to take a minute and identify two small and simple things he could do to be kind to his companion.

After a few moments, he shared his thoughts. Then I asked him to take a minute and identify two small and simple things he could do to be patient with his companion. He almost immediately shared his two thoughts. It was clear that he had already been pondering this before our meeting. I invited him to take those few items to God in prayer and to ask for confirmation, direction, and inspiration on how to execute his plan with real intent. He agreed. As we concluded, I asked him to provide a brief update in his weekly letter.

As the next few weeks went by, I could see in his weekly letters that things were improving. Not only could I see that improvement in his weekly letters, but I could also see it in the weekly letters of his companion. During our next in-person interview, I saw a night-and-day difference in his countenance and spirit. I asked him, âSo, Elder, is it true that âcharity never faileth?ââ He responded with a big smile, âYes, and by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.â

As you follow the Good News Recipe for happy living, remember President Nelsonâs teaching: âWhatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Learn more about His Atonement, His love, His mercy, His doctrine, and His restored gospel of healing and progression. Turn to Him! Follow Him!â

When you need to âhear Himâ and know how to invite Jesus Christ into your life, consider following the steps President Nelson taught us about personal revelation:

âFind a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort.

âPray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknessesâyes, the very longings of your heart. And then listen! Write the thoughts that come to your mind. Record your feelings and follow through with actions that you are prompted to take. As you repeat this process day after day, month after month, year after year, you will âgrow into the principle of revelation.ââ

I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. He has âaccomplished everything we need to be able to return to [our] Heavenly Father.â In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
