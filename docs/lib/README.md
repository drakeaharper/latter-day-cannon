## sql.js

To use the SQLite database functionality, you need to download sql.js:

1. Download the latest sql.js release from: https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/releases
2. Extract `sql-wasm.js` and `sql-wasm.wasm` to this directory

Or use CDN (already configured in the HTML):
- The app uses the CDN version from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.10.2/dist/

Files needed in this directory (if using local files):
- sql-wasm.js
- sql-wasm.wasm
