1â2, The Lord gives a commandment relative to admission to the united order.

1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment concerning my servant FrederickÂ G. Williams, that ye shall receive him into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.

2 And again, I say unto you my servant FrederickÂ G. Williams, you shall be a lively member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all former commandments you shall be blessed forever. Amen.
